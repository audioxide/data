# audioxide-data

This repository stores the data for the Audioxide API.

## Layout

### Data

Files are made up of multiple [YAML and Markdown files](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/markdown-yaml-cheat-sheet/). Sections are divided by a new line with three dashes (i.e. `---`).

1. The first section of any file contains metadata about the post/author/entity the file describes.
2. Any section that follows may either contain YAML syntax, with custom data (such as review information) alongside section content in a `review`, `content` or `body` property, or markdown formatted content or a plain string.

**NB:** All data in this repository should be treated as public!

#### Post files

Post files should contain at least two sections: metadata, and at least one content section.

##### Filename inference

The filename of a post file can also contain data about the post. This makes for a handy shorthand method of adding and editing data.

Post filenames should be formatted as `[date]-[post type]-[slug].md` and these values will be used if no other value is specified in the post metadata section. The post title will also be inferred from the slug if one is not specified, by replacing hyphens with spaces and converting the string to sentence case.

The date should be formatted as `YYYYMMDD`.

To override any of the data in these values, specify `created` and/or `modified` dates, `type`, `slug` and `title` in the post metadata section of the file.

###### Example

Where post filename = `20200422-reviews-eob-earth.md`

The following post metadata will be inferred:

```
created: 2020-04-22T00:00:00Z   # Wednesday 22nd April 2020
modified: 2020-04-22T00:00:00Z   # Wednesday 22nd April 2020
type: reviews
slug: eob-earth
title: Eob earth
```

This is an example of a content section. I am able to use markdown syntax such as **bold** and _italics_.

I can also freely spread content across multiple lines.

The only caveat is that horizontal rules must have more than three dashes such as

-----

or the HTML tag

<hr />

otherwise this content will count as a new content section.

author: andrew-bridge

review: >-
 This is another content section, but it uses YAML syntax to provide further metadata about this
 specific section of content, such as the section author. This is most used by reviews, where each
 section is written by a different person.

 I can still write across multiple lines, and write in **bold** and _italics_.

 Note the single space indentation at the start of each line. YAML is pretty relaxed with this, but
 you should _at least_ have this indentation on the **first** line of the content.

tracks:         # As with tags above, both per line and array format/single line are acceptable
  - So Good
  - 足足Vampires
  - 足足Jasmine

score:          # To make scores even stupider, notice that here, a "score" and "max" property are required
  score: 7      # This is verbose and inconsistent with the totalscore above and will be better in the future
  max: 10
  fraction: 0.7

artistMBID: 00000000-0000-0000  # A MusicBrainz ID for the artist solely discussed in this section; used by articles; optional
albumMBID: 00000000-0000-0000   # A MusicBrainz ID for the album solely discussed in this section; used by articles; optional

---

We can continue to write as many content sections as we like in either format.

Note also, that Markdown allows for HTML tags to be used within it, allowing for more involved styling
to be used in content

```

#### Images

Images have been imported directly from the Wordpress upload directory, and as such have a `YYYY/MM/file.jpg` format. This format is **not** required, but may be worth continuing with or reorganising entirely. However, as post files manually reference image paths, reorganisation would require re-referencing, which would need some code automation to do sanely.

During generation, images are regenerated at multiple sizes and aspect ratios to allow for performant and flexible display in the site. These sizes are determined by the `./data/images/sizes.json` file. This file provides a name for a size, and specifies width (or `w`) and, optionally, height (or `h`). If no height is specified, the same value as width is used.

Files will only be reduced and cropped and will not be enlarged if they are smaller than the size specified.
