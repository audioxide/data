review: <div class="_d97"><p>It wouldn’t be a new record from post-rock’s most
  overtly political band without a damning press release that blasts social
  injustice and demands revolution. ‘An end to foreign invasions. An end to
  borders. The total dismantling of the prison-industrial complex. Healthcare,
  housing, food and water acknowledged as an inalienable human right. The expert
  fuckers who broke this world never get to speak again.’ Given the sheer
  strength of such powering words, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this sets
  up Godspeed You! Black Emperor for their most furious album yet. Whilst the
  sound is vast and menacing in stature,<em> Luciferian Towers</em> lacks the
  abrasive power that made <a
  href="reviews/godspeed-you-black-emperor-f%E2%99%AF-a%E2%99%AF-infinity/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">their debut such an authoritative
  record</a>.</p><p>Godspeed aimed for ‘wrong notes that explode’, which is
  immediately evident on the throbbing opener. Like most songs on the record,
  “Undoing a Luciferian Tower” focuses on a simple hook, made to stir with
  support from a rousing arrangement that is sometimes sombre, and sometimes
  uplifting. The truth is that not every note that explodes is necessarily
  ‘wrong’, and the music can border on rousing film composition. It’s far from
  generic, but still a little tame for Godspeed’s usual standards. Their anger
  is more controlled than ever, and as a result this is a far easier listen than
  most of their earlier work, but not necessarily as rewarding. Nevertheless,
  <em>Luciferian Towers</em> is a fine record, and will almost certainly scratch
  any post-rock itch one might have. The album’s final stretch, “Anthem for No
  State” is a glorious conclusion that I particularly recommend.</p></div>

  ‘Apocalyptic’ is a word often thrown Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s way — and
  with good reason — but it doesn’t apply here. *Luciferian Towers* is a
  different animal, its tone righteousness and fury rather than rumination. The
  group’s famed ruinous tint is present, but it’s in service of a more
  redemptive project. There’s a discipline to *Luciferian Towers* that’s deeply
  affecting; a controlled, raging anarchy. Restless and powerful. There are no
  lulls here. In the spaces between the fury there are things weightless and
  beautiful. Guitars and drums and strings roar and sing, and horns rise to the
  sun. This is a world away from pensive wanderings of [*F♯ A♯
  ∞*](<reviews/godspeed-you-black-emperor-f%e2%99%af-a%e2%99%af-infinity/>).
  I’m thankful for the existence of both, but *Luciferian Towers* is purposeful
  in ways most of the post-rock albums we’ve listened to are not.

  There’s something carnivalesque about the record. Its irreverence, its livid hope, the simultaneity of strength and impermanence. Opener “Undoing a Luciferian Towers”, with shades of the matador, promises a grotesque and glorious showdown, and that’s what the record delivers. The guitars on “Bosses Hang” are like a stampede. The violins throughout are dances in fire. The finale of “Anthem for No State” — and so of the album as a whole — is a triumph. I’m quite smitten with *Luciferian Towers*. It isn’t perfect, but it is wonderful. The power of post-rock is so often delivered in a teasing, glancing blow kind of way, so it’s exhilarating to hear a group like Godspeed really leather something. I should mention that I thought all this *before* reading [the band’s manifesto and accompanying notes](<http://cstrecords.com/cst126/>). You don’t need to agree with Godspeed’s grand demands to enjoy *Luciferian Towers*… though I daresay it helps.

  My knowledge of Godspeed You! Black Emperor prior to my first listen of
  *Luciferian Towers* was incredibly limited. Despite the best efforts of a
  close friend at university, I hadn’t managed to sit through an entire record —
  intimidated, perhaps, by the 20-minute runtimes of their tracks. *Luciferian
  Towers*, in rebuke of that intimidation, feels like a comparatively digestible
  experience. Ironically, both “Bosses Hang” and “Anthem for No State” play
  through their respective triads of parts with no distinctive breaks between
  them, rendering their compartmentalisation fairly superficial, and retaining
  the band’s characteristic penchant for the long haul. Nonetheless, the
  ponderous nature of the album’s composition, with walls of deliberately
  engineered white noise extending over minutes at a time, has a dissociative
  impact on my consciousness that wholly trivialises my sense of duration. The
  harsh introductions of tempo shifts alongside interruptions of its melodies
  shook me immediately from the stupor that *Luciferian Towers* repeatedly
  lulled me into. The emotional awakening is simultaneously satisfying and
  jarring, and the steady build to its demi-crescendos never felt laborious.

  The naming of its tracks invites you into a narrative that barely exists within the album itself. *Luciferian Towers*’ major achievement, for me, is in the willingness with which you’ll fill in the gaps for yourself, drawing lines between its signposts as it rolls through sonic aesthetics lifted from Scottish Highlands and the streets of dusty towns in the Old West. In spite of its moodiness and sombre demeanour, the album’s general sense of victory and triumph over that darkness never feels absent. The record, throughout, evoked a rising sun in my mind, with shadows peeling away as each track marched onwards, leaving me in a state of peace long after its final screech.
