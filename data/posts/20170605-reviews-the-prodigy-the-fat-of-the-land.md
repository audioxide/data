review: "When it comes to the ‘90s, opinions often sway to both extremes, but
  there’s no denying that it was host to a wide variety of excellent electronic
  music. Whilst [Aphex
  Twin](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/aphex-twin-richard-d-james-album/>) and
  Air were offering a calmness that was otherwise absent from dance music, [The
  Chemical
  Brothers](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/the-chemical-brothers-dig-your-own-h\
  ole/>) and Fatboy Slim tapped into huge arena-rock sensibilities, propelling
  big beat to the very forefront of popular culture. The Prodigy, meanwhile,
  took one step further by applying a punk aesthetic to the electronic field,
  which ironically made them the most accessible and popular act of them all —
  at least for a period. *The Fat of the Land*, their acclaimed 1997 record, is
  loud and boisterous; packing the visceral punch of rock and brutally blending
  it with bass-drenched blasts. With such theatrical production comes a sense of
  novelty: it’s easy to see why this thunderous noise made an impact 20 years
  ago, but the shock factor has slightly worn off. “Breathe” and “Firestarter”
  remain major highlights, whilst “Climbatize” and “Narayan” offer something
  smoother, and the record benefits from the change of pace, even if it’s only
  subtle. Despite fluctuations in intensity, the general vibe is very much the
  same throughout. What *The Fat of the Land* lacks in diversity, it makes up in
  consistency: pulsating basslines and thrilling beats, polished with a
  grittiness that, at the time, was exclusive to The Prodigy. It doesn’t have
  the timelessness of records such as *Endtroducing…*, *Selected Ambient Works
  85-92* or even *Moon Safari*, but *The Fat of the Land* is nonetheless an
  extremely accomplished dance record."

review: "*The Fat of the Land *is a very good dance album and a decent album. I
  don’t have the joy of dance in my heart, so it isn’t terribly useful to me,
  but the vibe is strong for as long as you feel inclined to not listen too
  closely. I always feel a little iffy about music that isn’t supposed to be
  heard, but the sound here is fresh and lively and has aged pretty well. It
  gets better as it progresses, with “Narayan” and “Firestarter” probably edging
  my favourite tracks. The record is obviously a product of the late ‘90s, but
  it’s a good one. It has the crisp, glistening drive typical of the best that
  era of electronic music had to offer. The album is hardly a treasure trove,
  but it isn’t really trying to be; it’s a steady, confident dance drone, and on
  that level I recommend it heartily."

review: If nothing else, *The Fat of the Land* has certainly left a legacy. With
  at least two of its tracks still on regular rotation, it only improved on The
  Prodigy’s solid track record of releases through the ‘90s. Their third studio
  album manages, for the most part, to avoid the pitfall that many dance albums
  fall into by remaining listenable at home, and memorable long after its dying
  moments. There’s a midpoint that does teeter ever so close to the edge, with
  “Diesel Power” and “Funky Shit” both rolling and developing over their central
  themes, but remaining content enough to go no further. However, the curious
  “Mindfields”, slightly reminiscent of the [N64’s Goldeneye
  soundtrack](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCgLK2KxI9I>), and the less
  abrasive, more trance-laced “Climbatize” both fire some variety into the
  tracklist without even mentioning the more familiar entries. Certainly, the
  more vocal led tracks seem to be those that have proven their remarkable
  staying power, with “Smack My Bitch Up” and “Firestarter” both leading their
  hooks with short, cutting vocals. As an album, *The Fat of the Land* is pretty
  great, though certainly not a calming listen for a Sunday afternoon. As a
  dance album, it plays in a higher tier to a lot of dance music, both in 1997
  and now (which unfortunately includes their own recent output). It holds up
  well two decades later, and is certainly still worth a listen.
