pullquote: Fucking crazy
summary: As with a lot of Death Grips' output, a great deal of The Power That B
  seems like it shouldn't work, it's just a huge, crazy wall of sound, and that
  makes for an exhausting listen; yet it works well despite it all.

review: I certainly enjoy *The Powers That B*, but I unfortunately see no need
  for it to be a double album; the two discs contrast stylistically and in
  fluidity. More importantly though, one side does not enhance the other, and
  with its overall length of 80 minutes you have to question if this is
  detrimental to the record as a whole. It doesn’t stop you from appreciating
  both sides separately, but it does affect the overall cohesiveness. Another
  shot of adrenaline from Death Grips then, as you would expect, but it’s likely
  that I’ll proceed to consider *The Powers That B* as a release that contains
  two good albums with very little relation between them.

review: It’s a headful, but I like it. ‘Fucking crazy’ seemed to be my go-to
  description in our discussion, and I think I’ll stick with that. It’s fucking
  crazy. Sometimes it’s wonderful, but mostly fucking crazy. There should always
  be a place for that. The two sides seemingly have nothing to do with each
  other, but I suppose that might stem from the fact that the whole affair
  is fucking crazy. Well worth a listen, though that approval comes with the
  caveat that the two halves be treated as different albums.

review: "The two discs don’t bear much of a relation to each other, that’s my
  main gripe here. However, as with a lot of Death Grips’ output, a lot of it
  seems like it shouldn’t work, it’s just such a huge, crazy wall of sound, and
  that certainly makes for an exhausting listen, and yet it works well despite
  it all. There’s a lot more instrumentational exploration here too, which I
  certainly welcome, though I think I very slightly prefer the latter disc. Such
  a huge album means I will definitely be returning to this, and some of the
  catchier tracks will be getting more listens in the coming weeks! As an added,
  completely irrelevant bonus: some of those track names are brilliant!"
