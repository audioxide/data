review: As tempting as it is to brand Portishead’s debut as the definitive
  trip-hop record, *Dummy* is really a genre in itself. It took the dance
  foundations of Massive Attack and applied a greater sense of songwriting to
  the equation, resulting in one of the major landmarks of the ’90s. Spooking as
  much as it satisfies, *Dummy* is defined by a few aspects, not least its
  spectacularly bleak atmosphere, but hanging over its ominous backdrop is the
  somber voice of Beth Gibbons. Her chilling vocals are as eerie as they are
  beautiful, conjoining organically with the instrumentation to achieve one of
  the slickest combinations found in contemporary music. I have no hesitancy in
  branding the vocal performance on *Dummy* as one of the best on any record, of
  any time. Throughout the album Gibbons sounds ghostly, angelic, sometimes
  frightening, and on “Roads” — the album’s centerpiece — her expression is
  heart achingly beautiful. Still, for all its despair, *Dummy* remains
  strangely irresistible. It’s a record that is as sexy as it is sad, with its
  outlawed desires seeping through the dark web that only partially covers the
  shadowy tones of “Mysterons” and “Numb”. By the time we reach “Glory Box”, the
  only love/lust song of ‘94 to rival
  [“Closer”](<http://audioxide.com/reviews/the-downward-spiral/>) in sheer
  sincerity, the secret is out. *Dummy* is a wonderful record that is
  undoubtedly of its time, yet continues to thrive in the headspace of the
  modern listener.

review: Sensuous and glum, *Dummy *is all you can reasonably ask of a debut
  album. It announces itself as something new and distinct, and manages to do so
  with the wry, measured air of a veteran. Portishead’s murky, submerged sound
  provides a near-perfect accompaniment for Beth Gibbons’ near-perfect voice. It
  seems unfair for a human to be able to sound as beautiful as she does, but
  *Dummy *doesn’t waste the privilege. The work hits on a seriously sombre verve
  in the opener “Mysterons” and barely lets up all the way through. From the
  clunking groove of “Strangers” to the tender melodies and swelling souls of
  “It’s A Fire” and “Roads”, there is no shortage of wistful flair on show. It’s
  clear to see why the album’s blue, gloomy shadow looms so large, although I do
  think some of its sharpness has been lost in the years since its release. As
  meticulously produced as the songs are in sound, in composition they do
  occasionally scramble to keep up with the majesty of the voice guiding them.
  *Dummy*’s murkiness is part of what makes it so emblematic of the ‘90s, but I
  also think that quality cuts the record off from being iconic in its own
  right.

review: Portishead’s debut, *Dummy*, may be over two decades old, but their
  distinctively ’90s, trip-hop sound hasn’t aged a bit. From the opener,
  “Mysterons”, the album is immediately shrouded in eerie, ominous atmosphere.
  Melding orchestral and jazz samples with beats that often surge tracks
  forward, and melody lines that manage to remain intense and effective despite
  their minimal construction, *Dummy* remains intriguing for the listener
  throughout its tracklist. Floating effortlessly above these layers of sampled
  and effected instrumentation, vocalist Beth Gibbons provides one of the most
  distinctive elements of Portishead’s music. Always delicately yet firmly
  delivered, Gibbons proves her versatility, especially when comparing tracks
  like “It’s a Fire” and “Glory Box”, and often commands the whole character of
  the track with her vocals. With its sample punctured, jazz-infused, sulky, and
  sometimes sultry aesthetic, *Dummy* flows for close to an hour without ever
  outstaying its welcome, and has provided me with some of the most memorable
  moments in music. Spooky, smooth, and sensational.
