pullquote: Regrettably lifeless
summary: The undeniable significance of New Order is admirable, no question, but
  in the present day the core of their music feels regrettably lifeless. With
  this release, the catchy riffs and toe-tapping beats are there, but that's
  precisely the problem – stubborn in nature, with very little desire to change,
  they are just there.

review: The undeniable significance of New Order is admirable, no question, but
  in the present day the core of their music feels regrettably lifeless. With
  this release, the catchy riffs and toe-tapping beats are there, but that’s
  precisely the problem — stubborn in nature, with very little desire to change,
  they are just there. Whilst there are some highlights (the resigned closer
  “Leave Me Alone” is New Order at their most interesting), *Power, Corruption &
  Lies* ultimately leaves me feeling cold.

review: It comes bizarrely close to being immensely listenable. There are good
  tunes, some lovely mixing, all the makings of a great album, but it just winds
  up being a bit drab. It’s so drawn-out. *Power, Corruption & Lies* takes its
  sweet time not accomplishing very much. It’s like pop music’s answer to
  padding an essay so that it hits a word count. You can see why people were so
  irritated that “Blue Monday” wasn’t on the album; most of what’s there instead
  is so boring. It’s a shame, because when it’s good it’s very good indeed.

review: Having been so popular at the time, and having come out around the same
  time as the very successful “Blue Monday,” I want to see what others see when
  they describe it as ‘headrushing, joyful and flawless’, but I can’t. At least
  listening now, without any sentimental emotions attached, even I, with my high
  tolerance for repitition, get tired of a lot of the tracks on *Power,
  Corruption and Lies*. The instrumentation is relatively standard, I don’t get
  on with the vocals on many of the tracks as I don’t feel there’s any heart
  behind them and I mainly feel that they fail as pop tracks, because they are
  all too long. Unfortunately, this album was a disappointment.
