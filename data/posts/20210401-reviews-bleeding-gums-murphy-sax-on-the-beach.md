  What is the language of the soul? Some might say French, others Sanskrit, though both those suggestions would be wrong because it’s actually Bleeding Gums Murphy playing the saxophone. The man once hailed by [Miles Davis](/reviews/miles-davis-kind-of-blue/) as ‘the coolest man I’ve ever met’ was a generational talent, and he only needed one LP to prove it.

  Merging jazz lounge suavity with airport lounge sadness, _Sax on the Beach_ is the twilight hours sobbing companion you never knew you needed. Decades on from its release the record still simmers with raw, often obscene saxual energy. From the title track to “Love on the Rocks with a Twist” (a personal favourite) the music is miserable, yes, but also sophisticated and deeply moving.

  The short-lived Springfield Bum Notes backing band sets the cold, smelly back alley scene while still giving Murphy the room he needs to bring you down, and boy does he. Look no further than the 28-minute sax solo in “St. Donickus”, which is as deflating a spell of blues as you’re ever likely to hear anywhere. Masterful.

  Although it is regrettable that Murphy slipped into obscurity soon after the album’s release and died young, to me that sprinkles in the final seasoning of sadness needed for his work to age as well as it has. You can’t fake the blues, baby, and few records are better at making you feel worse than _Sax on the Beach_.

  As the first and only release from Bleeding Gums Murphy, Sax on the Beach is the lasting legacy for a forgotten master of jazz. Bitterly blue, it’s said that this was the album that stopped Louis Armstrong singing “What a Wonderful World” for an entire year! It’s not hard to see why when you dig into this tracklist.

With fan favourites that Gums played live like “I Never Had an Italian Suit Blues” and “Altissimo Rupture”, to deeper cuts like “Blue Moon Jazz” and “Love on the Rocks with a Twist”, this album exemplifies the beautiful misery he was able to impart on his audience. For the lucky few who saw him live, seeing these moments in real life was no doubt achingly beautiful. On record, Bleeding Gums hard life is laid bare on Sax on the Beach, from brotherly estrangement to Fabergéal financial ruin to dental calamity, the soulful howling and gravely tone is terrific.

It’s a damn shame the greats go before their time. Bleeding Gums Murphy deserved a long career of making other people feel worse, even if just for a moment. The skills he possessed are on full display in this album, making for a scintillating listen. I’m not at all surprised to hear that an incorporeal Billie Holiday is said to have commented that she “wouldn't have kicked Gums out of bed in a hurry”, and if you want to get a taste for why I’d implore you to seek out this record.
