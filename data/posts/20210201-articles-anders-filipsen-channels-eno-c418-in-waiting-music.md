Danish composer [Anders Filipsen](https://www.andersfilipsen.com/) has released an album called _[Waiting Music](https://andersfilipsen.bandcamp.com/album/waiting-music)_, and I think it’s really, really good. Composed of unedited live takes of four synthesizers, the tracks flow with the gentleness and grace of a Spring breeze. Although it has all the hallmarks of great ambient music, there are enough wildcards sprinkled across the album to keep it from feeling at all samey. 

The closest things we’ve reviewed on Audioxide are probably _[Ambient 1: Music for Airports](/reviews/brian-eno-ambient-1-music-for-airports/)_ and side two of David Bowie’s _[Low](/reviews/david-bowie-low/)_, both of which are the mastery of one Brian Eno. No surprise, then, that Filipsen cites Eno as an inspiration. Where _Ambient 1_ gave its tracks numbers, Filipsen opted for roman numerals. There’s that sense of clarity with both, of rising through the clouds and breaking through to see endless clear skies.  

Filipsen says the goal with _Waiting Music_ was ‘stepping back and letting things take shape without intervention,’ and I think he’s delivered on that. The album is meditative, but it also has a playful streak - uninhibited rather than uneventful. On “VIII” there are even shades of C418’s arrangements for the _Minecraft_ soundtrack.

_Waiting Music_ is an altogether weightier project though. The overall impression is expansive and bold, but also deeply serene. Far from sterile or robotic, the album’s pensive, melodic flow feels more like the hum of nature. Ambient fans will be well served by its offerings. For my part I suspect I’ll be throwing the record on a good few times in the coming months.
