review: >-
  I once described Andy Stott’s music as ’sophisticated techno’. Not my finest moment. Even though I still hate myself for saying it, his brand of electronic music does provoke the use of such pretentious terms. Everything unravels at its own pace, with beats gradually mutating under the moody surface. Whilst other artists and producers often layer up to obscene degrees, Stott has a knack for finding beauty in miniscule details. It’s practically ambient music for club-goers. _Never the Right Time_ doesn’t differ much from previous records, except that it’s slightly more ethereal. Think Burial playing at [The Roadhouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsr-ORwIfMw&ab_channel=ItaliansDoItBetterMusic).


  I doubt _Never the Right Time_ will land with the same impact as other Stott albums, solely because it’s so similar. I can imagine some listeners being potentially disappointed by the sense of familiarity, though it doesn’t bother me so much. We’ve seen a small wave of UK artists inspired by the likes of Stott and Actress, but not many of them capture the beautifully nocturnal sensation of _Never the Right Time_. It makes me feel nostalgic for night-life, even though I’m an introvert who refuses to dance. The record is tailor-made for me, basically.


  The most memorable moments on _Never the Right Time_ arrive on the tracks with more energy, such as “Repetitive Strain” and “Answers”. However, I do find myself strangely enamoured with some of the more understated spots too. Alison Skidmore contributes vocals once again, which certainly lends the music a human quality, edging towards the realms of trip-hop. That said, I don’t always find her voice the most captivating. It works wonderfully on closing track “Hard to Tell”, but less so on “The Beginning”: not helped by an awkwardly mixed percussion part guiding the track forward.


  Despite these inconsistencies, I would still recommend _Never the Right Time_ to most fans of dub and techno. The atmosphere it provides is just so damn alluring, and the manner in which these beats organically transform is a selling point in itself. _[Anima](/reviews/thom-yorke-anima)__ _was a good record – in some ways Thom Yorke’s best - but some of the instrumentals sound like cold replicas of what Stott so elegantly and effortlessly achieves here. It’s unlikely to blow any minds, but _Never the Right Time_ is a journey worth taking.
