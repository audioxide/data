review: >-
  No question _Fortitude_ is an album with cheese, but it’s a cheese best enjoyed with fresh grapes and a good bottle of red wine. It’s artsy metal. High points somehow manage to make the genre feel ethereal, while the worst thing that can be said about the lows is that they blend into one big highly agreeable drone.


  The record’s centrepiece is the one-two punch of “Fortitude” and “The Chant”, is the catchiest power chord rain dance chant I’ve ever had the pleasure of hearing. Sitting as they do smack bang in the middle of the 50-minute runtime, they give _Fortitude_ a lovely shape. It revs up, roars, and winds down. Just right.


  Not that Gojira deliver a tour de force here. Were it not for the tracks mentioned I suspect my overall response would be much closer to lukewarm. But they are there, so let’s bask in the warm, fuzzy feeling of a good listen, where the tracks land and the mix is just right. It almost makes metal feel dignified. Almost.
