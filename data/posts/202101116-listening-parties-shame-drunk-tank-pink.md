## ‚ÄúAlphabet‚Äù


**You**
Always up for a cantering start

**Andr√©**
Crikey, vocal delivery is very IDLES

**You**
Yeah, exactly, IDLES, Slaves is what I think of immediately

**Andr√©**
Lyrics too actually

**Andr√©**
Lovely snare rolls throughout this

**Andr√©**
Good opener!

**You**
Yeah, it's a nice noisey brash open

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúNigel Hitter‚Äù


**You**
Oh, that's a change of pace

**You**
Kinda groovy

**Andr√©**
This really reminds me of FEET, that band I went on about loads 2 years back

**Andr√©**
Yeah super grooby

**Andr√©**
*groovy

**Andr√©**
That bass tone is strange but kinda great

**Andr√©**
This is a proper toe-tapper

**You**
Yeah, I like all the guitar tones, it's bright

**You**
And yeah, I've been nodding my head from the start of this one

**You**
Note this as a potential favourite already

**Andr√©**
Excellent percussion overdubs all over the place

**You**
Lovey little percussive patters going on around my head

**Andr√©**
Yep haha

**You**
In a lot of ways I'm reminded of jittery indie rock of 15 years ago

**Andr√©**
Yeah the guitar work especially

**Andr√©**
But more DIY

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúBorn in Luton‚Äù


**Andr√©**
Wow

**You**
There's a lot more of that percussive rhythm going on in the background

**Andr√©**
The guitar work and production is pretty fucking rad

**Andr√©**
A lot to take in

**You**
It's really nice

**You**
It is yeah

**You**
That kind of percussive background always makes me want to mention Talking Heads

**Andr√©**
I can see why haha

**Andr√©**
This slower section is really nice

**You**
Taken a dip in tempo though

**You**
Wow, what a busy track

**Andr√©**
3 tracks in and the songwriting is more ambitious than I thought

**You**
I'm all for it, but there are beeps and bloops and roaring guitar

**Andr√©**
I kinda love the beeps and bloops lol

**You**
Oh I totally do, yeah

**You**
Alongside these tempo shifts too

**Andr√©**
This is great tbh

**Andr√©**
Really builds momentum

**You**
Yeah, it's turned into a pretty grand affair in four minutes

**Andr√©**
I mean, whisper it, but this is kinda the direction I wanted IDLES to try following Joy...

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúMarch Day‚Äù


**You**
Haha, what a finish

**Andr√©**
Yeah these guys really know how to get into a great groove

**You**
It's another change of pace, and I'm once again reaching for guitar music the NME used to cover in the 00s

**You**
Y'know, when they did music üëÄ

**Andr√©**
They give a platform for Tory MP's instead now

**Andr√©**
Quite literally

**Andr√©**
But anyway..

**You**
Haha, March Day is a good jaunt anyway

**Andr√©**
I honestly didn't realise these guys were so groove-based

**Andr√©**
I'm all for it

**You**
Well I'm certainly having fun with them

**You**
If I'm going to nitpick, this is slightly more straight down the middle than the previous tracks

**Andr√©**
I already know I'm gonna be coming back to this

**Andr√©**
maybe, nice change of pace I think

**You**
Yeah, I think I'll be spinning this a few times

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúWater in the Well‚Äù


**You**
That thudding drum and bass combo right out the gate is great

**Andr√©**
Oh I've heard this

**Andr√©**
Was one of the singles

**You**
Ah okay, it's a good single choice

**You**
Very satisfying chord progression

**Andr√©**
Yeah, though Snow Day was my favourite one, which is next

**You**
And the drums seem kicked up for me

**You**
My right ear just got pummelled haha

**Andr√©**
Drumming is great so far, quite unorthodox in places

**You**
In fact I think the kick is thumping on the right every phrase or so

**You**
Stonking final section to this track too

**Andr√©**
This would go down very well live

**You**
I was just about to say that

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúSnow Day‚Äù


**Andr√©**
I love this track

**Andr√©**
Really got my attention straight away

**You**
I've purposely left even the singles unlistened to

**You**
Although thirty seconds in, this is shaping up to be another strong track

**You**
So it makes sense that it's a single

**Andr√©**
Some of the industrial noises remind me of Daughters actually

**Andr√©**
Really interesting

**You**
Yeah, for sure, I can see that

**You**
It's a bit grimier, this

**You**
Big wall of sound

**Andr√©**
Oooooof this section is great

**Andr√©**
I can't get enough of this fucking drummer tbh

**You**
Yeah, "oooof" is right

**You**
I've thoroughly enjoyed the drumming thus far

**You**
Not to take away from the rest of the band

**You**
There's some cracking musicianship here

**Andr√©**
Yeah maybe more than I initially thought

**Andr√©**
You sometimes get the wrong impression with punk bands

**Andr√©**
Not these guys

**Andr√©**
They can fucking play

**You**
Well punk doesn't always go hand and hand with great musicians, just a passion for what they're doing. But it seems these guys have both

**You**
This driving section towards the end is another great close to a track

**Andr√©**
Seems like a centrepiece of sorts, this song

**Andr√©**
Very good

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúHuman, for a Minute‚Äù


**You**
That's an earthy bassline

**Andr√©**
Slower, but still groovy

**Andr√©**
How you feeling about the vocals?

**You**
Was just about to mention the vocals, he's got a range of styles

**Andr√©**
It's quite low in the mix a lot of the time. Allows everything else to shine

**You**
I think as a respite from the rest of the tracklist thus far, these softer, spoken vocals fit well with the rest of the track

**You**
I'm glad he mixes it up though

**You**
Yeah, although being lower in the mix, they have the potential to be missed, I've been enjoying the instrumentals

**Andr√©**
Agree on all counts

**Andr√©**
This one is a nice change from the frantic nature of previous songs

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúGreat Dog‚Äù


**You**
I'll sound like a broken record about the ending, I'll say it differently, they build and layer tracks well

**You**
Certainly another change of pace

**Andr√©**
Here we go then

**You**
Ah the vocals are getting a bit more of an outing eh?

**Andr√©**
This is more of what I expected initially

**You**
I wouldn't have been upset if this was it. i too was expecting this noisey, raucous, manic pace

**Andr√©**
Haha, this is ace

**You**
Type of thing that slaps a smile on my face

**You**
Yeah, imagine watching that live

**Andr√©**
## ‚Äú6/1‚Äù


**Andr√©**
That guitar has my attention already

**You**
Yeah, me too, some interesting crossing rhythms

**Andr√©**
Gonna mention drums again, my word

**You**
That'll always hold my attention

**You**
Agreed on the drums

**You**
It's that agitated, twitching drum line

**Andr√©**
Yeah perfectly put

**Andr√©**
We need to make a point of catching these live when normality returns

**Andr√©**
I've heard brilliant things already

**You**
The back half of this albums puts me into a sweaty gig next to someone that's spilt multiple pints over themselves

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúHarsh Degrees‚Äù


**You**
And not giving a shit

**Andr√©**
Haha

**You**
Well that was a thump

**Andr√©**
Yeah this is proper punk momentum now

**Andr√©**
I'm all for it

**Andr√©**
Backend of the album feels like a build-up to a big crash

**You**
I swear I'm listening to something other than the drums, but there's a kind of a 3 over 4 rhythm going somewhere in there that's scratching an itch

**You**
Yes, I wonder how they'll close

**Andr√©**
I am enjoying this.

**You**
The guitars are doing a stellar job here

**Andr√©**
Quite a bit

**Andr√©**
Love how the guitars offer this weird computer-malfunction type of texture

**Andr√©**
## ‚ÄúStation Wagon‚Äù


**Andr√©**
Here we go, closing track

**You**
Yeah, very into the distorted fuzz

**You**
Well that's a moody, atmospheric start

**You**
Maybe the crash happened and this is the comedown

**Andr√©**
Yep

**Andr√©**
Love the mellow vibe

**You**
I'm in suspense, but maybe I should be in reflection

**You**
Maybe this is falling out of the sweaty gig

**You**
It's a long closer though, so maybe it's ramping up

**Andr√©**
Nice backing vocals

**Andr√©**
Makes a change from the shouts and screams previously haha

**Andr√©**
Piano!

**You**
Yeah, this is similar to the respite we got in Human, for a Minute

**You**
Have we had anything besides a standard guitar band instrumentation before now?

**You**
Piano is certainly notable

**Andr√©**
I don't believe so

**Andr√©**
This is a real moment, isn't it

**You**
Indeed, they were ramping up to something after all

**You**
Oh that's a dirty guitar pushing its way in

**You**
Here we go

**Andr√©**
Powerful this.

**You**
Yeah, I think we're heading straight for a huge wall of noise

**You**
Phew

**Andr√©**
I was totally immersed in that

**Andr√©**
What a brilliant closer

**You**
My goodness, yes, at the start I thought it might've been a low key closer

**You**
Honestly, that was a pleasure to listen to

**Andr√©**
Yeah, I'm definitely going to be returning a lot. Quite comfortably the best thing I've listened to this year.

**You**
Haha, quite the accolade on January 15th üòâ

**Andr√©**
This feels like a momentous moment for them

**You**
But I'm with you

**Andr√©**
The pacing of the album was spot on

**You**
That's a brilliant follow up album

**Andr√©**
And there are so many subtleties that it could be a real grower too

**You**
Some excellent playing, satisfying rhythmic games being played in the background, great production

**You**
Agreed on the pacing too

**Andr√©**
Let's catch 'em live.

**You**
If we're ever allowed
