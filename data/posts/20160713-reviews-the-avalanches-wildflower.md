summary: Wildflower is brimming with positive energy, and is a worthy, if
  lopsided follow-up to the acclaimed Since I Left You. The music is carefree,
  graceful, and extremely accessible, with an open-ended structure that makes
  the listening experience feel like a vast and joyous journey.

review: '<div class="_d97"><p>The Avalanches have finally returned with a new
  record, and it’s fairly good. Thank heavens. <em>Wildflower</em> is brimming
  with positive energy, and is a worthy, if lopsided follow-up to the acclaimed
  <em>Since I Left You</em>. The music is carefree, graceful, and extremely
  accessible, with&nbsp;an open-ended structure that makes the listening
  experience feel like a vast and joyous journey. Core tracks are connected by
  gorgeous instrumental interludes, meaning the record flows effortlessly in a
  unified, summery package. <em>Wildflower</em> promptly sets a jubilant tone
  with “Because I’m Me”, and&nbsp;the rest of the album follows suit with breezy
  beats and psychedelic tones. The feature of guest vocalists is what really
  sets it apart from <em>SILY</em>: some work well, others less so, but they are
  all cohesive collaborations. Most of the miscues occur in tracks that feature
  rappers (“Live a Lifetime Love” is an unwelcome distraction, whilst “Clumsy
  Eater” is charming in its absurdity), whereas the indie pop songs are
  generally a success. <em>Wildflower</em>’s one significant blemish is its
  lacklustre final third, which tends to drag out the tail of the record. After
  a while you’re just a little fed up of waiting for it all to end, which is
  unfortunate considering the strength of what precedes the slog. The nostalgic
  novelty doesn’t wear off as such, but it does reveal the album’s dependence on
  the feel-good sensitivities of Summer, and I wonder if the experience relies
  too heavily on its seasonal&nbsp;warmth. Even so, <em>Wildflower</em> is a
  solid&nbsp;return, and I hope we get to see another album from The Avalanches
  sooner rather than later. They’re clearly well equipped and fully capable of
  creating a brilliant record —&nbsp;<em>Wildflower</em> will assuredly age more
  favourably if it’s followed by an excellent continuation, becoming&nbsp;the
  start of a rewarding new Avalanches era. As of now, it’s a welcome sequel that
  generally pushes the right buttons and almost, <em>almost</em>, gets it spot
  on.</p></div>'

review: "*Wildflower*, The Avalanches’ long-awaited follow-up to *Since I Left
  You*, has arrived in one piece. One bouncy, sunny, protracted piece. It comes
  out of the blocks strong. “Because I’m Me”, for all intents and purposes the
  opener, is a dynamically mixed old-meets-new summertime soul drive with
  serious charm. The track throws a gauntlet down to the rest of the album,
  which does a serviceable job of picking it up again. The Avalanches’ 2000
  debut is a daunting work to live up to, but the opening half of *Wildflower*
  holds its own — albeit, admittedly, through sheer force of bombastic sunshine.
  “Colour” and “The Noisy Eater” are personal highlights. The former is a
  seamless psychedelic dream, and the latter is so joyously silly that I can’t
  help but love it. My warmth does fade, though. *Wildflower *is an hour long,
  and I’ve found myself clock-watching each listen. The latter tracks lack edge,
  and the ease with which I slip into boredom does leave me wondering just how
  striking the openers really are. Still, there’s plenty to enjoy here. The
  Avalanches have returned, their plunderphonic talents seemingly intact. This
  felt like finding out whether an engine’s dead. There’s some promising, even
  vigorous revs in *Wildflower*, but not that roar of life. Not yet. Fingers
  crossed for a refined follow-up-follow-up appearing before 2032."

review: "It’s been a long time coming, but The Avalanches have given us a new
  record with a lot to like about it. A sun-kissed tracklist makes it a timely
  release and gives enough of an Avalanches signature to satisfy fans of their
  cult classic debut, *Since I Left You*. Besides that, *Wildflower* sees an
  emphasis on making something simply fun to listen to, with Nickelodean infused
  tracks like “The Noisy Eater” making for some of the best play time on the
  album. As expected from the group, known for their plunderphonic composition,
  sampling is generally creative, engaging, and expansive throughout, with most
  transitional segments working extremely well and the whole release sounding
  cohesive. Unfortunately, *Wildflower* does fall down towards the end, with the
  summery, Disney pop melding together while the transitional segments become
  more of a staple. What results is a lot of fun ideas which are never given
  enough of a chance to make an impression, and I find myself checking my watch
  in the closing minutes. It’s a shame given the overall quality and cohesion of
  the release, but it isn’t a disaster. It’s a solid return for The Avalanches,
  and feels like a strong start: let’s hope they will continue it more speedily
  than they did this time round."
