review: >-
  A fair bit of stuff from our youth isn’t nearly as cool as we found it at the time, so it can feel risky to revisit sometimes. I needn’t have worried on this one. _Is This It_ is the James Dean of indie rock. Cigarette perched on lower lip, bloodshot eyes squinting into the middle distance, the album is the genre’s poster child - the impossibly cool standard by which all pretenders must be measured and found wanting. 


  Twenty years on the record still has a swaggering zest to it. What goes on feels almost punk-like in its self-assurance and lack of pretension. Julian Casablancas drawls along like a sloshed downtown Socrates, with riffs fizzing like firecrackers and the rhythm section keeping to the ramped-up tempo of the city. It has the sleaze of a [Tom Waits](/reviews/tom-waits-rain-dogs/), the pep of [Arctic Monkeys](/reviews/arctic-monkeys-favourite-worst-nightmare), and it all sounds like a million bucks blown over a weekend. Only it wasn’t blown at all. That was the only way it could be. The band knew what it wanted to achieve and executed with aplomb. 


  My gushing out of the way, is the album a classic with a capital C? I’m not sure, though if not it’s certainly a classic of its kind. A lot of music from the years that followed wished it sounded like _Is This It_, but none of it really came close. There could only be one. Even if a few tracks (“New York City Cops”, for example) slip into the overly frayed feel of [later records](/reviews/the-strokes-first-impressions-of-earth), overall it’s a grand young time. It’s been lovely to come back to.
