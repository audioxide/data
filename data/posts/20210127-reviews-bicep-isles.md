  _Isles_ is a gleaming, whirring android of a soundtrack. Too bad, then, that it’s supposed to be an album. It’s hard to escape the feeling you’ve dropped into Bicep’s world _in medias res_, with unheard hours of polished, passive electronic experiments stretching beyond its ‘start’ and its ‘end’. That’s an approach that can work, of course. As Brian Eno so aptly put it in the linear notes of _[Ambient 1: Music for Airports](/reviews/brian-eno-ambient-1-music-for-airports/)_, the goal for a project like this is often to be ‘as ignorable as it is interesting.’ The fatal flaw in that philosophy, as we’ve seen time and again, is that if you’re not Brian Eno the end product often winds up being plain old ignorable.

  As ever with albums like this I feel I should add the caveat that if you like electronic music that’s ‘good in the background,’ this is a fine album. Sleek, modern, and 50-minutes long, _Isles _has nothing on [Boards of Canada](/reviews/boards-of-canada-music-has-the-right-to-children/) or [Aphex Twin](/reviews/aphex-twin-richard-d-james-album/) but it’s a sound serving of new tunes all the same - a sonic vat for your brain. There just isn’t much to think or feel about it once you’re in. And to those of you saying, ‘But Fred, [you’ve reviewed an actual soundtrack album before and given it an eight](/reviews/mogwai-atomic/),’ keep those facts to yourself. This is just words on a screen. I can’t answer you.

  Bicep followed their 2017, critically acclaimed debut with an extensive world tour. Then a break in 2019. Unbeknownst to the electronic duo, it would be a longer break than expected, with the worldwide pandemic hitting them in 2020 along with the rest of us.

  Their return to the studio, with follow up Isles, is understandably different in its mood. Matt McBriar's widely pulled quote that this new album is the "home listening version" and that "the live version will be much, much harder" speaks to this shift in sound. A lot of the music here feels as though it'd pair well with misty, night time drives. Pensive, cavernous and isolated; tracks roll and evolve their ideas in slow-motion.

  "Atlas" opens the tracklist with an ethereal cry out into a seemingly endless space as its synth line swoops and whips around, accompanied by firm bass stamps. The cry adds a melancholic, even mournful tone to the whole track and it's a feeling revisited throughout. Clara La San's vocal feature on "Saku" centres around being alone and needing to feel something again and the track's wavering central chords layered with whirling strings certainly complement the feeling.

  There are other highlights within the tracklist too, "X" opens with a Kraftwerkian, kinetic motif and evolves with wave after wave of horizonless, sweeping synths. "Lido" is a beatless interlude of a track that leans into ambient influences and creates a smokey atmosphere and a pregnant pause that leaves the listener in suspense. "Hawk" is a pacy closing track with a twitching, erratic melody that does an excellent job of getting my head nodding.

  But ultimately the suspense that Isles builds through many of its tracks rarely have the pay off they deserve. Tracks swirl about at a slower pace than in their previous release, and it often feels as though in creating a "home version" they've instead cut out some of the excitement. While the duo has always focussed on simply arranged electronica, at times, it can feel like a "Bicep-lite" rather than a "Bicep at home", with diminished variety and texture across the board.

  I'm still looking forward to a "much, much harder" version of some of these tracks, and more from Bicep in general. However, Isles feels like the musical manifestation of the wait we're all enduring before we can return to live music.
