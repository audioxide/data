I think the moment my parent’s band arrived was when they offended a gaggle of neo-fascists which had inexplicably wandered into their gig at The Dublin Castle in Camden. My mum belting out the chorus of “Little Fascist Head” was well received by those of us in the crowd who thought fascist heads are indeed on the small side, but a handful weren’t best pleased. They stormed out, the band finished its set, rock and roll prevailed. Another day in the life of Dr Rob & the Radi8ors.

Formed in the wake of David Bowie’s death (someone had to take up the torch) the Radi8ors have been busy. In five years they’ve recorded three studio albums and a live album, gigged across London and southeast England, and orchestrated several concerts to raise money for UNICEF. On Sunday, the five-year anniversary of Bowie’s passing, they released their third and quite possibly last studio album, [_This Is Now_](https://open.spotify.com/album/2idIvKgMFDUWBSBHUfV4rh).

Just as a fly on the wall it has been quite a ride, one that deserves attention. Mum has twice suggested that I, Andre, and Andrew could review one of their albums. I have twice suggested that would not be happening. Instead I wanted to write about the band as I see it, which is to say not impartially.

No words will quite do justice to what I’ve been privy to over the last few years — the work, the laughs, the tears, the heartache, and highs that made it all worthwhile. From magical gigs to one-liners worthy of _Spinal Tap_ (‘Why do you have four amps?’ ‘I couldn’t afford five’) it’s been the full rock and roll package, a beautiful and messy tempest.

The lineup a couple of years to settle, but I for one wouldn’t change it for the world. On guitar is (Doctor) Robert Doyle, my stepdad; on vocals Eda Kuran, my mum; on bass John Rigg; and on drums Jose Joyette. Together they are the Radi8ors, four formidable disciples of rock and roll in the vein of Pixies, Public Image Ltd, Blondie, and, of course, David Bowie.

It took a lot of work for the Radi8ors to find their sound -- weekly practices, rewriting, refining, exploring. Rob and I developed a tradition in which he’d play me mixes he’d slaved over for weeks, I’d cheerfully explain everything wrong with them then saunter off to make some tea, and he’d resist the urge to rip my arm off and beat me to death with the song. This eventually earned me the moniker Judge Fredd. Just know, dad, I do it out of love.  

Though I’m not sure they’ve ever quite managed it over the course of an album, there are certainly songs where the Radi8ors touch the heavens together. Take “Heard It from the Buddha”, a song so cool that it has to be performed wearing shades, or “Jesus Wept”, written on November 9th, 2016, which perfectly bottles the near-sublime whatthefuckery of Donald Trump becoming the most powerful person on the planet.

“Are You Coming Round” and “Shelly Mae” are personal standouts from _This Is Now_, magnificent songs by any standard, and there are plenty more where they came from.

The Radi8ors catalogue has been performed across southeast England, as mentioned at The Dublin Castle, the Gulbenkian, at Margate Rocks, in flint-walled basements and coastal bunkers. The Radi8ors have radiated far and wide in their time. There’s no saying whether they would have secured slots on the 2020 summer festival circuit, but they would have deserved it.

Their music has been a constant backdrop over what has been a rather turbulent five years. Out in the world there has been Brexit, historic disinformation, political turmoil, and the coup de grasse of a global pandemic. Closer to home, my sister grew up and left for university; my brother and his partner were wed and had a beautiful baby boy; Eda has unlocked her considerable talents as a painter, the nine pictures on the cover of _This Is Now_ her own work. The family dog, Sid, passed away two summers ago, and it is strangely comforting to know that when the first two Radi8ors albums were being recorded he was chilling out in the middle of the studio floor, rock and roll blasting through his lovely, empty head.

I worry sometimes that Eda, Rob, John, and Jose aren't as proud of themselves as they should be. Like many artists, they’ve struggled to curry favour with industry tastemakers — be they radio hosts or playlist curators — and find the wider audience their material deserves. Like many artists, I don’t think that reflects their quality. Some make it, others don’t. It’s hard enough when artists are in their twenties with marketable names, let alone when they’re touching 60 and called ‘Dr Rob & the Radi8ors’.

I’ve almost certainly shrugged off their concerns with some hippy bull about the journey being more important than the destination, but I understand the hunger. When you pour your heart into something you want that to be recognised. You want it to reach and connect with as many people as possible. There’s time yet, you never know.

All the same, the band is already a triumph. It’s a triumph of music, of the will to make things and put them out there. Like Bowie before them, when I listen to the Radi8ors and am reassured that youth is a state of mind, the audacity to create new things. Not everyone has the time or resources to run a band, of course, but not everyone has the will either.

My understanding was the original plan for the band was three albums. With _This Is Now_ they’ve achieved that. Eda and Rob don’t have ‘Stop’ settings so who knows what’s next. Whatever the future holds for Dr Rob & the Radi8ors I hope they know how much it was worth while it was happening. They're already rockstars in my eyes.
