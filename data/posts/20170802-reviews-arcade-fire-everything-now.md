review: >-
  As an avid admirer of Arcade Fire’s first three records, *Everything Now* has
  been a truly miserable experience for me. Not because it’s necessarily an
  awful album — though it does flirt dangerously close — but because the band
  give me absolutely nothing to care about. Arcade Fire are renowned for their
  grandiose artistic statements, avoiding oversentimentality and resisting
  overblown arrangements, whilst still proving to be deeply affecting. Songs
  drenched in emotion that capture captivating hooks and rise to anthemic
  choruses: songs about agony and grief that somehow wind up sounding totally
  joyous. Regrettably, there is absolutely nothing joyous about *Everything
  Now*, an album that demonstrates how a grand statement of sorts fails to
  translate without substantial songwriting (and how you don’t stand a chance
  when the statement itself is not only misjudged, but horribly heavy-handed).

  Stylistically, *Everything Now* picks up from where *Reflektor* leaves off; caught in a disco-dazed frenzy, only this title track is nowhere near as effective as the last. It ticks all the boxes on paper — catchy melody, infectious groove — but there’s simply no heart or soul. The beat encourages a tap of the feet, but the song’s message induces a roll of the eyes. There’s very little emotional connection or means of attachment in comparison to previous album openers, such as “Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)” or “The Suburbs”. The concept falls further apart with songs like “Chemistry” and “Infinite Content”, which are quite easily the worst cuts Arcade Fire have put on record. The most frustrating track of all is “Electric Blue”, a delightful instrumental spoiled by a strangely excruciating vocal performance from Régine Chassagne. Songs featuring Chassange on lead vocals have proven highlights in the past, but “Electric Blue” is almost unlistenable due to her grating falsettos. It’s like a drunken karaoke cover of Thom Yorke. The album picks up towards the end, but by that point the damage is well and truly done. *Everything Now* is not only obnoxious in its social critique, it’s also an utter bore, relying on flimsy disco with hints of half-arsed punk and characterless reggae. The good news is that I’ll have forgotten about it by next week.

review: "*Anything Now* sounds like the kind of thing you make when you’re
  tired. A good idea at the time, but exposed in the light of day as jangly and
  poorly executed. The goal was disco with a kick, or least that’s my best
  guess. It’s hard to believe everyone involved was on the same page. Although
  the record sometimes drifts into a genuinely colourful, confident sound, most
  of the time it is oddly clunky. The music just doesn’t seem comfortable in its
  own skin — and with good reason. Even at their best the songs don’t sit right.
  The instrumentals on “Creature Comfort” and “Electric Blue” are what you’d
  hope to hear from Arcade Fire Do Disco, but even there the vocals fall short.
  Régine Chassagne’s voice, in isolation, is soft, fluttering, and beautiful.
  This is known. Combined with disco-rock it sounds like nails on a chalkboard.
  Something like that isn’t anyone’s fault — the Bee Gees doing
  [*Funeral*](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/funeral/>) would sound just as bad,
  maybe worse — but it is neatly symbolic of how ill at ease Arcade Fire sound
  on *Everything Now*. It lacks self-assurance. By the time the record bumbles
  into reggae hoedown “Chemistry” and *Big Bang Theory*\\-worthy punk epic
  “Infinite Content”, I’m barely engaged enough to be disappointed. I still
  manage, though. Arcade Fire are a terribly talented group, and it’s a shame to
  hear them so off-key. There’s enough right with *Everything Now *to think they
  can make that sound work in the future, but I doubt many will want them to
  have another go of it. The album doesn’t leave me the slightest bit angry, but
  it does leave me cold. And that might be even worse."

review: There is no two ways about it, *Everything Now* is not a patch on Arcade
  Fire’s previous output. Going from strength to strength from their [2004
  debut](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/funeral/>) right through to their
  similarly disco-heavy 2013 release, *Reflektor*, I’ve long held high
  expectations for a new release from the band. *Everything Now* feels like a
  misstep though. While the opening minutes aren’t a cause for concern, things
  very quickly go in a surprising direction as the listener reaches the meat of
  the album. While there are some genuinely extraordinary moments like the
  country inspired “Infinite\_Content” or reggae-lite “Chemistry”, a bulk of the
  tracklist feels mundane. Instrumental introductions often lead the listener to
  hold out hope, as many are distinctive and enjoyable. But with some
  interesting vocal and arrangement choices and lacklustre development across
  the board, each track pales rapidly. There are stand out tracks, but nothing
  that saves the album, instead bookending a blur of ideas with something
  vaguely memorable. It’s a real shame, as the band’s previous output has had me
  returning over and again to relive the gorgeous, affecting moments created
  with beautiful vocals and warm instrumentals from early in their career and
  genuine fun in their more recent releases. That said, I won’t be surprised if
  I return for a selection of the tracks on this album as there is still some
  fun to be had, but with a high-achieving discography behind it, *Everything
  Now* will likely drift into insignificance.
