blurb: Crunchy guitars and relentless percussion abound in Shame's new record 'Drunk Tank Pink'. Yes we're two weeks into the year, but a highlight all the same.

This is a series in which two of us listen to an album for the first time and chat about it as we go. These are our real first impressions, and any moments of insight are entirely coincidental.

## ‚ÄúAlphabet‚Äù

**Andrew**
Always up for a cantering start

**Andr√©**
Crikey, vocal delivery is very IDLES

**Andrew**
Yeah, exactly, IDLES, Slaves is what I think of immediately

**Andr√©**
Lyrics too actually
Lovely snare rolls throughout this

**Andr√©**
Good opener!

**Andrew**
Yeah, it's a nice noisey brash open

## ‚ÄúNigel Hitter‚Äù

**Andrew**
Oh, that's a change of pace
Kinda groovy

**Andr√©**
This really reminds me of FEET, that band I went on about loads 2 years back
Yeah super groovy

**Andr√©**
That bass tone is strange but kinda great
This is a proper toe-tapper

**Andrew**
Yeah, I like all the guitar tones, it's bright. I've been nodding my head from the start of this one
Think this as a potential favourite already

**Andr√©**
Excellent percussion overdubs all over the place

**Andrew**
Lovey little percussive patters going on around my head

**Andr√©**
Yep haha

**Andrew**
In a lot of ways I'm reminded of jittery indie rock of 15 years ago

**Andr√©**
Yeah the guitar work especially, but more DIY

## ‚ÄúBorn in Luton‚Äù

**Andr√©**
Wow

**Andrew**
There's a lot more of that percussive rhythm going on in the background

**Andr√©**
The guitar work and production is pretty fucking rad
A lot to take in

**Andrew**
It is, yeah, it's spot on
That kind of percussive background _always_ makes me want to mention Talking Heads

**Andr√©**
I can see why haha
This slower section is really nice

**Andrew**
Taken a dip in tempo though
Wow, what a busy track

**Andr√©**
3 tracks in and the songwriting is more ambitious than I thought

**Andrew**
I'm all for it, but there are beeps and bloops and roaring guitar

**Andr√©**
I kinda love the beeps and bloops lol

**Andrew**
Oh I totally do, yeah
Alongside these tempo shifts too

**Andr√©**
This is great tbh
Really builds momentum

**Andrew**
Yeah, it's turned into a pretty grand affair in four minutes

**Andr√©**
I mean, whisper it, but this is kinda the direction I wanted IDLES to try following [Joy](/reviews/idles-joy-as-an-act-of-resistance/)...

**Andrew**
Haha, what a finish

## ‚ÄúMarch Day‚Äù

**Andr√©**
Yeah these guys really know how to get into a great groove

**Andrew**
It's another change of pace, and I'm once again reaching for guitar music the NME used to cover in the 00s. Y'know, when they did music üëÄ

**Andr√©**
They give a platform for Tory MP's instead now.
Quite literally
But anyway...

**Andrew**
Haha, March Day is a good jaunt anyway

**Andr√©**
I honestly didn't realise these guys were so groove-based
I'm all for it

**Andrew**
Well I'm certainly having fun with them.
If I'm going to nitpick, this is slightly more straight down the middle than the previous tracks

**Andr√©**
Maybe, nice change of pace I think. I already know I'm gonna be coming back to this.

**Andrew**
Yeah, I think I'll be spinning this a fair few times

## ‚ÄúWater in the Well‚Äù

**Andrew**
That thudding drum and bass combo right out the gate is great

**Andr√©**
Oh I've heard this, it was one of the singles

**Andrew**
Ah okay, it's a good single choice. Very satisfying chord progression.

**Andr√©**
Yeah, though Snow Day was my favourite one, which is next

**Andrew**
And the drums seem to be kicked up a notch for me. My right ear just got pummelled haha.

**Andr√©**
Drumming is great so far, quite unorthodox in places

**Andrew**
In fact I think the kick is thumping on the right every phrase or so
Stonking final section to this track too

**Andr√©**
This would go down very well live

**Andrew**
I was _just_ about to say that

## ‚ÄúSnow Day‚Äù

**Andr√©**
I love this track. Really got my attention straight away

**Andrew**
I've purposely left even the singles unlistened to
Although thirty seconds in, this is shaping up to be another strong track
So it makes sense that it's a single

**Andr√©**
Some of the industrial noises remind me of Daughters actually
Really interesting

**Andrew**
Yeah, for sure, I can see that
It's a bit grimier, this
Big wall of sound

**Andr√©**
Oooooof this section is great

**Andrew**
Yeah, "oooof" is right

**Andr√©**
I can't get enough of this fucking drummer tbh

**Andrew**
I've thoroughly enjoyed the drumming thus far
Not to take away from the rest of the band
There's some cracking musicianship here

**Andr√©**
Yeah maybe more than I initially thought
You sometimes get the wrong impression with punk bands. Not these guys, they can fucking play

**Andrew**
Well punk doesn't always go hand and hand with great musicians, just a passion for what they're doing. But it seems these guys have both
This driving section towards the end is another great close to a track

**Andr√©**
Seems like a centrepiece of sorts, this song. Very good

## ‚ÄúHuman, for a Minute‚Äù

**Andrew**
That's an earthy bassline

**Andr√©**
Slower, but still groovy
How you feeling about the vocals?

**Andrew**
Was just about to mention the vocals, he's got a range of styles
I think as a respite from the rest of the tracklist thus far, these softer, spoken vocals fit well with the rest of the track
I'm glad he mixes it up though

**Andr√©**
It's quite low in the mix a lot of the time. Allows everything else to shine

**Andrew**
Yeah, although being lower in the mix, they have the potential to be missed, I've been enjoying the instrumentals

**Andr√©**
Agree on all counts
This one is a nice change from the frantic nature of previous songs

**Andrew**
I'll sound like a broken record about the ending, I'll say it differently, they build and layer tracks well

## ‚ÄúGreat Dog‚Äù

**Andrew**
Certainly another change of pace

**Andr√©**
Here we go then

**Andrew**
Ah the vocals are getting a bit more of an outing eh?

**Andr√©**
This is more of what I expected initially

**Andrew**
I wouldn't have been upset if this was it. i too was expecting this noisey, raucous, manic pace

**Andr√©**
Haha, this is ace

**Andrew**
Type of thing that slaps a smile on my face. Imagine watching that live

## ‚Äú6/1‚Äù

**Andr√©**
That guitar has my attention already

**Andrew**
Yeah, me too, some interesting crossing rhythms. That'll always hold my attention

**Andr√©**
Gonna mention drums again, my word

**Andrew**
Agreed, it's that agitated, twitching drum line

**Andr√©**
Yeah perfectly put
We need to make a point of catching these live when normality returns
I've heard brilliant things already

**Andrew**
The back half of this albums puts me into a sweaty gig next to someone that's spilt multiple pints over themselves
And not giving a shit

**Andr√©**
Haha

## ‚ÄúHarsh Degrees‚Äù

**Andrew**
Well that was a thump

**Andr√©**
Yeah this is proper punk momentum now. I'm all for it!
Backend of the album feels like a build-up to a big crash

**Andrew**
Yes, I wonder how they'll close
I swear I'm listening to something other than the drums, but there's a kind of a 3 over 4 rhythm going somewhere in there that's scratching an itch

**Andr√©**
I am enjoying this.
Quite a bit

**Andrew**
The guitars are doing a stellar job here

**Andr√©**
Love how the guitars offer this weird computer-malfunction type of texture

**Andrew**
Yeah, very into the distorted fuzz

## ‚ÄúStation Wagon‚Äù

**Andr√©**
Here we go, closing track

**Andrew**
Well that's a moody, atmospheric start
Maybe the crash happened and this is the comedown?

**Andr√©**
Yep
Love the mellow vibe

**Andrew**
I'm in suspense, but maybe I should be in reflection
Maybe this is falling out of the sweaty gig
It's a long closer though, so maybe it's ramping up

**Andr√©**
Nice backing vocals
Makes a change from the shouts and screams previously haha

**Andrew**
Yeah, this is similar to the respite we got in Human, for a Minute

**Andr√©**
Piano!

**Andrew**
Have we had anything besides a standard guitar band instrumentation before now? The piano is certainly notable

**Andr√©**
I don't believe so
This is a real moment, isn't it

**Andrew**
Indeed, they were ramping up to something after all
Oh that's a dirty guitar pushing its way in
Here we go

**Andr√©**
Powerful this

**Andrew**
Yeah, I think we're heading straight for a huge wall of noise

**Andrew**
Phew!

**Andr√©**
I was totally immersed in that
What a brilliant closer

**Andrew**
My goodness, yes, at the start I thought it might've been a low key closer
Honestly, that was a pleasure to listen to

**Andr√©**
Yeah, I'm definitely going to be returning a lot. Quite comfortably the best thing I've listened to this year

**Andrew**
Haha, quite the accolade on January 15th üòâ. But I'm with you

**Andr√©**
This feels like a momentous moment for them

**Andr√©**
The pacing of the album was spot on and there are so many subtleties that it could be a real grower too

**Andrew**
That's a brilliant follow up album. Some excellent playing, satisfying rhythmic games being played in the background, great production
Agreed on the pacing too

**Andr√©**
Let's catch 'em live

**Andrew**
If we're ever allowed
