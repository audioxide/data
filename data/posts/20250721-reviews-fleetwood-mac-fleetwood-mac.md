summary: "Archetypal Pulp: catchy, energetic and melancholic. The themes of each track have grown up just as the band have too, avoiding the revival landmine of talking like teenagers when you're old enough to parent one."

  Easy listening can be a dangerous game and so it’s proven here. My feelings on Fleetwood Mac’s self-titled 1974 album have slid gently from warm to lukewarm to tepid over several listens. Nice is nice, but without a bit of needle it can teeter into boring.

  That’s not to say there aren’t some great moments. Stevie Nicks frankly steals the show with “Rhiannon” and “Landslide” - to such an extent that I get that [_Surrealistic Pillow_](/jefferson-airplane-surrealistic-pillow) feeling of, ‘Why isn’t she singing on more tracks?’ Beyond that I actually struggle to reach for concrete examples.

  There are lovely spells in the tracklist certainly - the arrangements and production throughout are clean and gentle - but I’ve been surprised by how blurry the lasting impression has been. It’s like a half-remembered dream.
