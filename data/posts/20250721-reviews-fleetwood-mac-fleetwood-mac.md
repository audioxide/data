  Easy listening can be a dangerous game and so it’s proven here. My feelings on Fleetwood Mac’s self-titled 1974 album have slid gently from warm to lukewarm to tepid over several listens. Nice is nice, but without a bit of needle it can teeter into boring.

  That’s not to say there aren’t some great moments. Stevie Nicks frankly steals the show with “Rhiannon” and “Landslide” - to such an extent that I get that [_Surrealistic Pillow_](/jefferson-airplane-surrealistic-pillow) feeling of, ‘Why isn’t she singing on more tracks?’ Beyond that I actually struggle to reach for concrete examples.

  There are lovely spells in the tracklist certainly - the arrangements and production throughout are clean and gentle - but I’ve been surprised by how blurry the lasting impression has been. It’s like a half-remembered dream.

  I think we might ruffle some feathers here. Luke warm receptions to a classic like _Fleetwood Mac_ is a surefire way to lose friends and attaching adjectives as tepid as “nice”, “pleasant”, and “easy listening” will probably have some reaching for their pitchforks. It’s telling, however, that we all sniffed out the Stevie Nicks cuts on this album as our favourites without even knowing it. This is an album from a band in transition, with Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joining following Bob Welch’s departure, and a considerable portion of the track list repurposed from Buckingham and Nicks’ eponymous album, _Buckingham Nicks_.

  Album opener, “Monday Morning”, sits alongside “Rhiannon” and “Crystal” as highlights in this track list, but with the former two initially earmarked for the Buckingham Nicks follow up album, and “Crystal” having already been released on their first album (with a warmer, brighter arrangement to boot), these tracks feel distinctly different to contributions from the rest of the band. “Landslide” makes for another, Nicks penned, highlight in the latter half, standing out with its paired back instrumental and Nicks’ pained, ponderous lyrics.

  I do just find most of _Fleetwood Mac_ pleasant to listen to, as tepid a sentence as that may be. It’s got the beautiful mid-70s folk-rock sound throughout, and there’s some clear foundational work for a string of influential, excellent material from the band over the next decade. But between the dual personalities that come with writers getting comfortable with one another, the hand-me-down tracks and the lack of staying power from the rest, it’s hard to dwell on this album for long after it’s over.
