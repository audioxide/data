  2021 seems to be the year of the confident, brilliant debut, and Joy Crookes is giving me another reason to think so. _Skin_ has a knack for swaying between intimate, soulful jazz cuts and grander, orchestral pieces, making for a satisfying, moreish sound.


  Opener, “I Don’t Mind”, makes for a tasting menu of what’s to come on this album. Underlined by a subtle, electronic bounce, strings and keys unfurl as Crookes’ silky vocal glides across the top. Brass tidbits decorate and develop the track further to an effortless, warm affair. Continue listening, and you’ll find trip-hop beats next to folky, soul-jazz fusions, next to warm, sunny bops. “Unlearn You” is one of several evocative, piano-driven pieces that sound all the better for their dynamic range as the track swells and diminishes, a testament to both writing and production on this album. It’s hard not to hear a hint of Amy Winehouse here and there too, particularly in the likes of “When You Were Mine”, where the horn section pulls tempo as far as they dare against the snappy drum line backdrop.


  With _Skin_, Crookes has delivered an impressive package. Cinematic soul-jazz is a concoction that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed, and I hope future material will explore further than what we’ve heard here. For now though, this is a strong album that I can see myself returning to, and I can see Joy Crookes being an artist to watch over the next few years.
