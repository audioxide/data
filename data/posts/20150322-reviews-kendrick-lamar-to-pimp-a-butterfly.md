review: Ambitious in its attempt to inspire a generation to change a damaging
  culture, *To Pimp A Butterfly* is an album mainstream hip-hop has been longing
  for. The hard-hitting, inspiring lyrical content is supported by wonderful
  fusions of hip-hop, jazz and funk music, ensuring that not only is the album
  important, but also incredibly enjoyable. If *Good Kid, M.A.A.D City*
  introduced Kendrick Lamar to the masses, *To Pimp A Butterfly* cements his
  place in the hip-hop hall of fame. This is an instant classic, and I’m
  fascinated as to where Kendrick Lamar can go from here.

review: It’s candid, abrasive, and full of heart; an album as provocative as it
  is inspiring. The soundscape is varied and gorgeous, but the beating heart of
  the album is the voice of Kendrick Lamar, which is becoming increasingly
  important. *To Pimp a Butterfly* is a work that will quite rightly be revered
  for a long time. Amidst the frustration and despair there’s a lot of love in
  this album, and that love shines through.

review: I really enjoyed the album, the instrumentation is incredibly varied and
  very interesting, spanning various genres, the album remains fresh from start
  to end. There are little flourishes and additions which really do make some of
  the tracks that bit better. The production is great and adds atmosphere and
  realism all over the album, as well as putting the vocals front and centre.
  But putting that all aside, one can entirely hate this album, but they should
  still appreciate it. The time of release makes it incredibly relevant and
  important, with all of the various issues that it touches on, though as the
  final minutes of the album secretly inform us — it’s been relevant for a long
  time.
