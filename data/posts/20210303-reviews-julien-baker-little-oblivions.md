review: >-
  Julien Baker’s material as a solo artist is often characterised as fragile, raw and deeply personal. Drawing from turbulent personal experience, her lyrics often deal with mental health, substance abuse and a complicated relationship with religion. The lead single to her third release, “Faith Healer”, was a clear statement of intent to continue exploring and confronting these themes while upping the instrumental stakes.


  Baker’s lyrics remain the focus on _Little Oblivions._ Describing inner turmoils of addiction in “Crying Wolf” and anxiety and guilt in “Favor”, she paints visceral pictures of moment to moment struggles she’s dealt with. Their descriptive nature makes for honest, unabashed, confessional passages that evoke emotion and introspection if you listen closely enough.


  But just as the production value jumped between Baker’s debut and follow up, so too has _Little Oblivions_ added a new layer to the instrumentals. From the opener, “Hardline”, with its climactic end, to “Bloodshot”, with its tumbling drum rolls and vocal backing, you’d be forgiven for believing there was a whole team behind this album. On the contrary, Baker is credited with writing, performing and producing the entire tracklist, aside from some backing vocal contributions from her boygenius bandmates and post-production work. It’s a considerable achievement, but unfortunately, it isn’t one that works well for me. Where her debut’s single take, single instrument, raw aesthetic paired well with the lyrical content, the instrumentals here not only feel a little at odds but also don’t add anything to the story. Worse still, many of these tracks can sound very similar to one another, making any diversion, such as the piano ballad “Song in E” a highlight purely through the respite it provides.


  _Little Oblivions_ is an admirable work in many ways. Remaining confessional, introspective and human, there’s a strong sense of catharsis that I hope Baker achieved through this album’s release. To do so almost entirely by herself is admirable further still. But without sharing much common ground with many themes explored here, and left unaffected by most of the instrumentals, the tracklist closes without me feeling a great deal either way. Fans of hers and her contemporaries will likely feel quite the opposite, and I’m glad this has hit the mark for them. But I don’t see myself returning to this, and I’ll be far more likely to return to her previous releases instead.
