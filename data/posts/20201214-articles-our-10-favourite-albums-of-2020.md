blurb: It's the end of the year, which means we're legally obliged to round up our favourite albums. Here are our picks in the year of our Lorde 2019.

---

*The album is dead, long live the album. We’d be lying if we said this year of our Lorde was bursting with instant classics, but that’s brought its own charms. This was a slow burner year, where the best albums were weird and wonderful rather than tour de forces. From newcomers to old favourites there’s been a lot to love and a lot to look forward to in the coming decade.*

## 10\. *Purple Moonlight Pages* // R.A.P. Ferreira

*Purple Moonlight Pages* was my first experience of R.A.P. Ferreira, and I found it a totally spellbinding listen. Ferreira, previously known under the moniker milo, has created a diverting jazz/hip-hop record that expertly pays homage to the genres shared origins.

The album, which comes in at just over 50 minutes long, has a total of 18 tracks. Each is distinct and relatively short, giving Ferreira plenty of scope for experimentation and playfulness throughout the project. On “NONCIPHER” the spoken-word vocals and lyricism is complemented by whimsical call-and-response brass instrumentation, funky snares and hi-hats and playful piano. Ferreira is philosophising on the ‘true meanings’ of music, adopting a nihilistic mindset that, ultimately, meaning doesn’t matter. This ideology is carried throughout the entire album by the dissonant but gratifying instrumentation. “LAUNDRY” brings 90s record-scratching repetition, “DOLDRUMS” has a laid-back monotony with biting labial plosives, and “MYTHICAL” offers big-band brass and smooth jazz percussion. The vocal flows focus on phonaesthetics, combining intricate metaphors with diction that’s more for sound than substance. Ferreira uses assonance and dissonance poetically to complement the jazz instrumentation, making his vocals as much an instrument as they are a storytelling device.

It’s an album about freedom; freedom to experiment, freedom to play, freedom to reinvent yourself. It’s unlike anything else I’d heard this year, shifting rhythms complemented by twinking keys, smooth jazz percussion and phonaesthetic rap flows. Interesting enough to hold your attention, relaxing enough to play in the background, and delightfully unique. I’m so glad I stumbled upon *Purple Moonlight Pages*, it’s real food for the soul.

## 9\. *Punisher* // Phoebe Bridgers

**Marcus**

From the first melodically discordant notes of “DVD Menu” it’s clear what Phoebe Bridgers set out to do with her second studio album. Comforting and melancholic in equal measures, the record is best described as ‘emo-folk’, though I encourage you to disregard any negative preconceptions you might have of either of those genres. ‘Punisher’ brings out the best of both of them in a surreal, anxious but warming record full of dark metaphors, a permeating sense of dread and deliciously soothing folk production.

Aspects of the album that one could reasonably expect to be totally jarring, such as the way the upbeat pop instrumentation on “Kyoto” is followed up by the dark, melancholic and haunting “Punisher” are nimbly handled by Bridgers to create a contradictory but complementary sound. Bridgers’ conflicted mental state is candidly laid bare throughout the album, both lyrically and sonically. On “ICU”, lyrics like “I get this feeling whenever I feel good it’ll be the last time” show the dread that accompanies any sort of happiness when you’re in the grips of anxiety or depression. On “Chinese Satellite” the dominant theme of the album is captured in the opening lyrics “I’ve been running around in circles / Pretending to be myself”: a feeling of stasis combined with a pervasive anxiety about what the future holds and, for want of a less trite turn of phrase, the meaning of life.

I’d be remiss not to mention the closing track, “I Know The End”, which gives me goosebumps on every listen. The haunting chorus of “the end is here,” accompanied by heavy, choking breathing sounds leaves you enveloped in the dread that Bridgers has been battling throughout the album.

I found a real affinity with the emotions expressed by Bridgers in ‘Punisher’ this year: an anxious itch for self-improvement and change while being trapped in a static world, a world where it seems everything has fallen apart in a very mundane, anticlimactic apocalypse. It’s a coming-of-age album which holds a mirror to a world equally full of terror and opportunity, thoughtfully philosophising on a personal past and a collective future, and a true delight to listen to.

## 8\. *Making a Door Less Open* // Car Seat Headrest

![Album artwork of 'Making a Door Less Open' by Car Seat Headrest](album-artwork/making-a-door-less-open-car-seat-headrest.jpg "Album artwork of 'Making a Door Less Open' by Car Seat Headrest")

**Marcus**

Indie rock often feels stagnant and non-descript, trapped in a cycle of post-00s nostalgia, but Toledo’s vocal similarities to Julian Casablancas belie the inventiveness across the Car Seat Headrest discography. *Making a Door Less Open* is perhaps the boldest attempt at delivering something novel and, messy as it is, I can’t help but enjoy and admire the attempt. Infusions of electronica and EDM might seem like a cheap avenue for broadening the band’s touchingly naive sound, but plenty of the results here are so moreish and impassioned that it’s easy to glaze over its lower moments. Deadlines (Thoughtful)’s bar-long synth notes that smoothly glide between pitches sound nothing like the CSH we’re familiar with, and yet they’re absolutely in step with the band’s compositional approach — an emotive, ascendant, and slightly understated means of grabbing the listener and holding tight as the instrumentation builds in complexity. The glitched vocal hook in Hymn (Remix), the near-screams on Hollywood, the hollowed-out piano notes of Can’t Cool Me Down, and the acoustic stop-off at What’s With You Lately all seem intent on being jarring and sort-of-unpleasant, but the rough edges of CSH have always been their most addictive quality.

## 4\. *Græ* // Moses Sumney

![Album artwork of 'Græ' by Moses Sumney](album-artwork/grae-moses-sumney.jpg "Album artwork of 'Græ' by Moses Sumney")

**Andrew**

Moses Sumney followed up his 2017 debut this year, and he didn't take any half measures in doing so. With *Græ*, Sumney retains the powerful vocal performances that first turned my attention to him, and builds on the already lush instrumentation we saw in *Aromanticism*.

This double album is a grander affair in many ways, and it uses its 60+ minutes playtime to travel around a musical landscape. Back in May all three of us offered a comparison: Frank Ocean, Lianne La Havas and, my favourite, "Thom Yorke with steroids and a few hallucinogens in his belly". Returning to it, I could probably add a few more to the list, but Græ doesn't trade character for eclecticism and instead solidifies Sumney's absorbing formula of soulful electronic music.

It's hard not to retread covered ground, having gushed about the entire tracklist back in May, but I can't help but give one notable mention. After some time away from it, the rollercoaster that "Colouour" sends me on hasn't diminished. Opening with a horn section that flies and flutters around a cavern of reverb, Sumney's vocals enter delicately, as the rest of the track falls away for a moment, holding the listener in silence before dropping them back into a rippling, warm pool of lush chords. It's a real experience, and it's a track that missed out on my favourites list at the time.

With André's cracking write-up of "Me in 20 Years" last week and our original review on Græ, we've had a lot of praise for this album. Sumney has produced an enchanting, even overwhelming, hour of music that I'm delighted to see in our listing this year.

## 3\. *Visions of Bodies Being Burned* // clipping.

![Album artwork of 'Visions of Bodies Being Burned' by clipping.](album-artwork/visions-of-bodies-being-burned-clipping.jpg "Album artwork of 'Visions of Bodies Being Burned' by clipping.")

**Marcus**

Few projects are as inventive, bold, and focused as clipping.’s *Visions of Bodies Being Burned*, the second part of a dual-album project that began with *There Existed An Addiction to Blood* in 2019. Through sides E to H of the project, Diggs, Huston, and Snipes build upon and perfect their horrorcore motifs in what I consider to be a masterpiece. The development of Diggs’ deliveries, the willingness to warp any and all aspects of the composition into gothic, uncanny, and oftentimes miserable new modes, and the loosely-defined storytelling combine into an expansive and addictive listening experience that grows in grandeur with every listen. I’ve waxed lyrical about this album enough already, so I’ll close by noting that Enlacing’s ability to dive between its life-affirming choruses and dread-inspiring verses ought to be enough to convince anyone that clipping. are at the forefront of pushing and cracking hip-hop’s ever-flexible boundaries.

## 1\. *RTJ4* // Run the Jewels

![Album artwork of 'RTJ4' by Run the Jewels](album-artwork/rtj4-run-the-jewels.jpg "Album artwork of 'RTJ4' by Run the Jewels")

**Marcus**

Run the Jewels have always operated on the miraculous alchemy of Killer Mike and El-P, and each record’s growth in confidence from the duo is as astounding as it is impressive. On *RTJ4*, it feels like the underlying theme of improbably successful combinations has been ratcheted to another level — represented best, perhaps, by the coupling of Zach de la Rocha and Pharrell Williams on JU$T. Sticking a pitbull and a rabbit in a pen together seems like a terrible idea, and yet it comes off with aplomb. On pulling the pin, Mavis Staples’ haunting vocals are married impeccably to the trademark spookiness of Josh Homme’s instrumentation, such that I’m staggered the idea hasn’t been broached before. In these fraught times, this coming together of opposing sonic forces—going above and beyond the well - established synchronicity of Render and Meline — is as powerful as the predictably brilliant writing, not only in how great it all sounds but in its projection of RTJ’s overarching focus on solidarity against oppression.
