review: "*…Like Clockwork* is a welcome reinvention. The two Queens of the Stone
  Age records prior to this contained some great moments, but were far from
  accomplished albums. As a longtime admirer of the band, I had growing concerns
  that *Songs for the Deaf* was to be their pinnacle work, forever unmatched in
  a growing discography. Whilst *…Like Clockwork* doesn’t have the special
  quality that makes *Songs for the Deaf* the hard rock classic it is today, it
  is a great album that brims with flair and creativity, and ultimately raises
  the Queens to new heights of relevancy. Aside from a sketchy opening track,
  *…Like Clockwork* is as smooth a ride as you’ll ever experience. It is
  undoubtedly the bands most accessible album to date, and doesn’t sacrifice any
  of their tenacious swagger in achieving it. “I Sat by the Ocean” is a
  marvelous song with an effortless display of finesse, and “Smooth Sailing”
  sounds exactly like what Joshua Homme described as ‘trance robot music’ upon
  the bands formation in the late ‘90s: ‘to make something that girls could
  dance to, that had a freedom that Kyuss didn’t’. Indeed, Homme has had great
  ideas since the days of Kyuss, but as a songwriter, he has truly improved with
  age, and “I Appear Missing” is an emotive peak previously not seen on any of
  his albums. Fortunately enough, it absolutely excels. With a beautifully
  diverse supporting cast, here is an album that revels in its musicianship. The
  drumming from Castillo, Theodore, and particularly Grohl is an absolute joy to
  be behold, at times a real throwback to the likes of “No-one Knows” and “Song
  for the Dead”. To summarise, *…Like Clockwork* is a real treat; a necessary
  shot in the arm for one of the most respected rock acts of this generation. It
  doesn’t reach the intensifying highs of *Songs for the Deaf*, and it doesn’t
  try to, because Queens of the Stone Age have transformed. Gone are the days of
  Nick Olivieri shrieking down the mic to pulsating riffs; we now live in an age
  where Homme performs sensual piano ballads. And the crazy thing is, I’m no
  longer sure which is more satisfying."

review: There’s a whole lot to like about *…Like Clockwork*. It’s smart and sexy
  and revels in knowing it. Although the album draws from a ludicrous pool of
  talent (ranging wonderfully from the likes of Trent Reznor to Elton John), its
  voice still very much belongs to Josh Homme, who marshals the whole affair
  with swagger and verve. It listens like a new lease of life, and it’s
  infectious. Although it doesn’t necessarily coax out a great deal of
  sentiment, it bears mentioning that for the most part it doesn’t try to.
  There’s revelry going on, and as a listener it’s just nice to be along for the
  ride. Homme’s quip that rock ‘should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet
  enough for the girls’ rings true here; there’s a near perfect balance of grit
  and finesse on *…Like Clockwork* that surely makes it Queens of the Stone
  Age’s most accomplished work since *Songs for the Deaf*.

review: Queens of the Stone Age have always set the bar high with their albums,
  so *…Like Clockwork* had a lot to live up to. One could be forgiven for
  showing some brief concern at the album’s opener, “Keep Your Eyes Peeled”,
  which isn’t bad in any sense of the word, but takes its time to pack any
  punch, opting instead for a moody growl from the bass. Any concern is short
  lived however, with “I Sat by the Ocean” driving energy into the rest of the
  album. With a good variety of atmosphere from the likes of “The Vampyre of
  Time and Memory” and grit from tracks such as “My God is the Sun”, the album
  continues to surprise and grabs a firm hold on the listeners interest
  throughout. While easily missed through its effortlessness, the talent on
  display through *…Like Clockwork* is as stunning as ever, with Homme’s vocals
  sounding strong and some of the instrumental performances, especially some of
  the drum lines, leaving it near impossible for the listener not to be
  impressed. It’s a brilliant album that doesn’t try to be anything more than
  anything deeper than an approachable, lively listen from start to finish and
  achieves that and more incredibly well without resorting to any watering down
  of the genre, something which has to be commended in and of itself. The extra
  bonus here? The album sounds excellent live — go and see them. Grand and
  gritty throughout.
