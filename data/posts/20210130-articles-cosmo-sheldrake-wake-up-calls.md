_Wake Up Calls_ might be considered a curious audio diversion to some. But my last.fm profile - yes, I still scrobble alongside the other three of its users - tells me Cosmo Sheldrake’s album from late 2020 was still some of my most listened to music.

Created over nine-years, using recordings from birds on the red and amber lists of endangered British birds, Sheldrake layers and manipulates bird song to produce music as calming as it is beautiful. While “Dawn Chorus” might give you a C418-with-birds vibe, with its fizzy synth drone and counter-rhythm melody, much of this album feels a step further removed. Many tracks like “Cuckoo” and “Dunnock” have a tentative, mysterious air to them, as their slow, pitch-shifted warbles create a bassline akin to a woodwind ensemble with an eerie difference.

At the centre of the tracklist, “Cuckoo Song” is the only track with a vocal, moving the bird song to the background and focussing on a chorus of vocal backing to provide a pensive, delicate piece with a more intimate, human touch than the rest of the album.

By the closing moments, “Nightingale, Pt. 2” delivers a merry, quaint pastiche that sends me straight into the middle of a deserted forest, making it hard to pull myself away from the album. But just shy of half an hour, _Wake Up Calls_ has been and gone all too quickly, and I’ve certainly gone in for a second listen without hesitation.

Audio diversion or not, _Wake Up Calls_ made for a small corner of tranquillity at the end of my year. Playing it during a sun-filled dawn makes for quite the impact, and in these dreary days of winter, it can transport its listener to warmer, wilder climes. An effect I’d consider a superpower. For that, I can only thank Cosmo Sheldrake and heartily recommend giving his music a listen.
