“Still” is the latest single by PatternPusher, an art rock band from Exeter who claim to [captivate listeners in their mix of post-punk and electronic music](<http://www.patternpusher.com/#!bio/c161y>). For the opening few minutes, “Still” drives along smoothly in a dreamlike state, harking back to an ambiance prominent on The xx’s debut effort back in 2009. Gently delivered vocals drift over airy synths and velvety guitar licks: ‘Take me to a place where you are not lost’, sings Alex Johnstone, ‘where times haven’t changed and you’re still in my arms’, suggesting a reminiscence of a lost love. As the instrumentation increases in strength and intensity, “Still” gradually progresses into a dynamic and heavily textured number, with an energetic outro that brings one of Radiohead’s guitar-based climaxes to mind, drawing the song to a solid conclusion. “Still” is a real statement of intent from PatternPusher; a satisfying display of talent and craft that doesn’t outstay its welcome despite its length. In fact, the band show more than enough in five minutes to suggest that a full-length LP is not beyond their means.
