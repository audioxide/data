## “You Think I Ain’t Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire”

**André**
Still one of my favourite album opener of all time
That explosion still blows my mind

**Fred**
‘Prepare to have your mind expanded, friend’

**André**
I think a big part of why people find Nick Oliveri’s screaming tolerable is because it’s quite low in the mix
And nicely mixed, furthermore
I hear a lot of people say ‘I don’t like scream vocals in metal… except when QOTSA did it’

**Fred**
I think it’s because they treat it as part of something bigger
Rather than the main event

## “No-one Knows”

**André**
That 1-2 combo is SO good
Not a huge surprise that this album has more songs from Songs for the Deaf than any other

**Fred**
Did any albums not make the cut at all?

**André**
Yeah. Lullabies to Paralyse
Which is some people’s favourite actually
Has some fab singles like Little Sister and Burn the Witch
Even a Villains song made it…

**Fred**
So what is this?
…Vulgar Songs for Villains (Rated R)

**André**
Hahaha
Yes
Grohl’s drumming still reigns supreme here, my goodness
I will never get bored of No-one Knows

**Fred**
Safe choice putting it second
Works well, would you believe

**André**
Incase you didn’t know – whatever place the songs are on this album, are the places the songs are from on that respective album
So, this next song, If Only, is the 3rd song from the debut album too
Pretty neat! Well done r/qotsa

**Fred**
Interesting!

## “If Only”

**André**
Love that riff
Josh sounds so young!

**Fred**
The production bridges over pretty well

**André**
When Josh Homme speaks about ‘robot rock’, this is one of the tracks that always comes to mind

**Fred**
It’s just so cool
And not ironically cool
Looking at you, Villains

**André**
Driving with the roof down on a Summer’s day kinda cool

**Fred**
So did you vote in this?

**André**
I did

**Fred**
Any of your songs not make the cut?

**André**
Plenty
I CANNOT believe Song for the Dead didn’t make it
An utter travesty
Instead we have this…

## “If I Had a Tail”

**Fred**
Ah I adore this song
1 2 3 4…

**André**
I dig it. It’s just no Song for the Dead is all
Sublime groove though, no doubt

**Fred**
This is the song I was thinking about when I said Homme could make a phone book sound groovy

**André**
Haha
I think in many ways Like Clockwork is Homme’s best work
Songs for the Deaf is my favourite but this album just really hit the spot
It almost felt like Queens of the Stone Age v2.0
Previous albums were good but not like this

**Fred**
You know when talented footballers reign in the flair to make the most of their potential?
That’s how I feel about the two
Songs for the Deaf is more exciting
But Clockwork is immaculate

**André**
If it had a stronger opening track, like SftD does, it would have been a near masterpiece
The only song that lets it down in my opinion

**Fred**
Ah, I like it

## “Better Living Through the Chemistry”

**André**
I’m SO glad this song made it
One of the tunes that made me fall in love with the band as a teen
Riffs fucking everywhere
Plus BONGO’S

**Fred**
What else?
This playlist injects a good variety doesn’t it?

**André**
For sure
There’s even a piano ballad later on – gosh
But this is proper stoner rock
Love it

**Fred**
It’s like this song was custom made for people like you to nerd out
And me, to be fair

**André**
This had stiff competition too – My God is the Sun, The Sky is Fallin’, Burn the Witch

**Fred**
Yep, good company
Haha, even the L/R balance is all over the place
Love it

**André**
Haha yeah they branched out on Rated R
This was definitely the most drug-fuelled one
I mean the album starts off with Feel Good Hit of the Summer…

## “Un-Reborn Again”

**André**
Ah, the best Villains song

**Fred**
We called it

**André**
We’re rarely wrong
This works so well after Chemistry

**Fred**
Such a funky song
This is the only one on the record where they got the production just right

**André**
Sounds fucking great doesn’t it
I associate the album with a distinct lack of low-end punch, but not this one
And those synths sound FAB

**Fred**
Serious crunch

**André**
It has a snarl
That all QOTSA music should do

**Fred**
But it also nails the kitsch tone

**André**
It does
I love Homme’s delivery too

**Fred**
It’s spot on

**André**
I haven’t gone back to Villains much, but I’m loving this!

**Fred**
This was why Villains was frustrating though. The rest of the album could have been like this but it sounded like it had been entombed in plastic

**André**
You’re right…
Ronson takes a good share of the blame, but not all of it

**Fred**
God the outro is so great

**André**
The strings are a nice touch
As is the sax!

**Fred**
‘Do dooooo’

**André**
Magnificent

## “Mexicola”

**André**
Yay another riff-fest!
Cannot get enough of this song
Strange hearing his voice so low in the mix though
You can tell his confidence wasn’t high back then, as a singer

**Fred**
He sounds good
Not as refined maybe, but that’s part of the charm I suppose

**André**
Yeah I think so
I think the debut album was more about the riffs, the grooves and the attitude
Song-writing came with Rated R
Think this stands up to something more modern like Un-Reborn Again?
Or does it sound dated to you?
I think it sounds of it’s time for sure, but still sounds great

**Fred**
I think there’s some yin and yang about it
Un-Reborn sounds great, but it’s so polished

## “3’s & 7’s”

**André**
That wasn’t a particularly smooth transition on the production front
I didn’t vote for this, but it’s a great single

**Fred**
I actually thought the drop from Un-Reborn to Mexicola worked a treat
But yeah, the climb back up to this, not so much

**André**
I voted for In the Fade here
Which is a bit more laid-back, slower pace.
Which I think was necessary after Mexicola
But hey ho
This is still a TUNE

**Fred**
It is
I don’t think it works very well in the playlist

**André**
Agreed, probably the weakest spot

## “I Appear Missing”

**André**
Ahhhh

**Fred**
Here we go

**André**
The behemoth
My god this song..
Is this the best thing Homme has written?
Sorry, that’s a bit disrespectful to the rest of QOTSA, I’m fairly sure they all write it

**Fred**
It’s out there now, Andre
I’ll edit out that other stuff because it was vulgar, but that stays

**André**
It’s ok reddit doesn’t have a history of witch-hunts….
*ahem*
The drums !!!
Jon Theodore you boss

**Fred**
This is a great song, but I’d say it hits harder in the context of the album

**André**
3’s & 7’s lessens its impact slightly
I think when it comes down to it, my favourite QOTSA song will always be between this and Song for the Dead.

**Fred**
Amazing to think of the evolution between those two songs
The distance the group has travelled musically

**André**
They don’t get enough credit in that regard

## “…Like Clockwork”

**André**
This was the only sensible way to follow I Appear Missing, surely?
Well done r/qotsa

**Fred**
There are a couple of times where songs have to come in pairs

**André**
Millionaire – No-one Knows

**Fred**
Aye

**André**
And I Appear Missing – Clockwork

**Fred**
Aye aye
Funnily enough, I think I’ve enjoyed Un-Reborn Again the most so far

**André**
Who could’ve predicted that?

**Fred**
Homme entering Pink Floyd orbit right about now

**André**
I think this is their 2nd best closing track
I Think I Lost My Headache is my favourite

## “God is in the Radio”

**André**
Oh that transition is glorious

**Fred**
Songs for the Deaf really has something special
This song feels unstoppable every time I hear it

**André**
It’s wonderful
I think the under-stated drum beat plays a massive part
Grohl thrashes his way through the rest of the record but here he really does let the guitars, and Mark Lanegan’s voice, do the talking
He’s enabling them

**Fred**
Honestly, I usually prefer that style of drumming

**André**
I think there’s a balance to these things
Love this breakdown
DYNAMICS people. So important
I’m not sure the end of this song is going to fade into Fun Machine all that elegantly…

## “The Fun Machine Took a Shit & Died”

**André**
Yeah, no. Haha

**Fred**
This does not belong

**André**
Doesn’t quite follow God is in the Radio does it?

**Fred** 
Nooooooooo

**André**
But I have a lot of time for it

**Fred**
Ok how about this
Remove 3s & 7s and Fun Machine from the playlist and they can be B-sides for whatever the lead singles are

**Andre**
Haha hell yeah
The first third of the playlist was ace
Almost the first half, in fact

**Fred**
Yeah, it’s almost uncannily good

**André**
But things are a little jarring after that
The last 2 songs are gonna work very well though, seeing as it’s the end of Songs for the Deaf haha
So this curated album starts and ends with two Songs for the Deaf tracks
Which speaks volumes

**Fred**
Indeed

**André**
I’m a little exhausted at this point, with Fun Machine

**Fred**
We are over an hour in now

**André**
True enough

**Fred**
Would be interested to hear r/qotsa put together a 40 minute album in whatever order they liked
Though the logistics of that would be horrible

## “Song for the Deaf”

**André**
This is such an ominous song
I adore it

**Fred**
It probably gets harder to mesh the albums as they get further along because they’re working towards somewhere different

**André**
Absolutely.
Though Like Clockwork into God is in the Radio was a fantastic transition
Some things just click

**Fred**
‘Forrrr the deafffff’

**André**
‘ha ha ha ha ha haaaaa’

## “Mosquito Song”

**Fred**
Lush

**André**
With this, Like Clockwork, Headache, and of course Long slow Goodbye from Paralyse, QotSA sure know how to end a record
This is particularly special, it feels spiritual
This has been very nice
Thanks again to r/qotsa
I think the first half was outstanding so bravo

**Fred**
Yeah, lovely
Exhausting too

**André**
Yeah, perhaps 14 songs is a bit much when it’s not paced accordingly

**Fred**
Now make a 40 minute one
I’ll wait

**André**
And I’ll vote
