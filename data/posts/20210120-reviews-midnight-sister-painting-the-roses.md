  Los Angeles duo Midnight Sister are not short on ideas. Their sophomore album *Painting the Roses* is an eclectic mixture of indie rock and baroque pop, with not-so-subtle nods to psychedelia, jazz, dance, and classical music. Not every experiment pays off, but there’s bound to be something for everyone to enjoy. The record feels remarkably loose; a trait that delights and frustrates in equal measure.

  The album thrives on its unexpected moments: the fuzzy guitar solo on “Foxes”, the outrageously groovy bassline on “Sirens”, the cinematic string motif on “My Elevator Song”. Just to name a few. Midnight Sister offer plenty of surprises with instrumentation, so it’s a shame that their songwriting can often feel so passive. *Painting the Roses* is unpredictable, but I take no issue with that. In fact, I end up enjoying the experimental tracks more than the laid-back indie strolls, as pleasant as they may sound.

  Although *Painting the Roses* falls short of greatness, there’s plenty here for listeners to enjoy. The aforementioned “Sirens” is just an absolute jam, offering a similar sensation to one of [Arcade Fire](/reviews/arcade-fire-funeral/)’s greatest dance anthems “Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)”. Elsewhere, there are hints of glam-rock and power pop in the same vein as The Lemon Twigs, another eclectic American duo. Only, with much less chaos. If that sounds like your type of thing, then *Painting the Roses* comes recommended.

  *Painting the Roses* is an otherworldly record. More New Orleans than Los Angeles, it’s all jazz and fog and magic, as innocent as a child’s make-believe. It’s a jumbled world with an eclectic range of sounds. The cuddly psychedelia of “Foxes” has shades of [the Beatles](/reviews/the-beatles-revolver/), while the magnificently groovy “Sirens” wouldn't feel at all out of place on [the finest Talking Heads records](/reviews/talking-heads-remain-in-light/). Throughout Juliana Giraffe’s vocals mesh seamlessly with the arrangements, sounding almost Nico-esque on gentler tracks like “Wednesday”. With horns, harmonies, and funk aplenty it makes for a lovely thing to listen to.

  That so many artists of this caliber come to mind while listening to Midnight Sister (and I could go on) speaks both to their fine chemistry and to the slight looseness of the album overall. Dancing through so many sounds suits the project’s light, playful tone, but it does leave you wondering what *their* sound is. That glass-eyed non-focus is all that really keeps me from loving the record, because for long spells it’s an absolute pleasure to sink into. God knows life could have a bit more whimsy like this in it right now.
