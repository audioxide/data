review: <div class="_d97"><p>For <a
  href="https://audioxide.com/reviews/san-fermin-jackrabbit/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">our review</a> of San Fermin’s second studio album
  <em>Jackrabbit</em>, I wrote that ‘the album in its entirety can feel slightly
  taxing due to the bloated, overstuffed nature of the songwriting.’ This
  unfortunately seems to be a staple of Ellis Ludwig-Leone’s writing, because
  <em>Belong</em> contains the exact same problems that held <em>Jackrabbit</em>
  back from being one of the best albums of 2015. In fact, it’s even more
  bloated, and it contains even less highlights. Though the usual
  instrumentation has largely remained, it’s immediately clear that
  <em>Belong</em> has an emphasis on electronic samples and textures, with an
  opening track that is far too loose to set any sort of scene. “Open”, like a
  lot of tracks here, is a decent number that would surely thrive with a little
  more focus and attention to detail. “Oceanica” initially has vast potential to
  develop into something interesting, but winds up feeling like a song that
  Ludwig-Leone has made to show off his fancy new synthesiser with a built-in
  arpeggiator. On the flip side, “Bride” is the closest thing to replicating the
  memorable jig of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4rnD3628N4"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Emily”</a>, whilst “Dead” is, rather
  ironically, one of the only tracks that actually sounds alive. Sadly, too many
  songs are concerned about building towards yet another musical crescendo or
  climax, and the content simply fails to match the concept. Music written by a
  composer of this class should never feel formulaic, but it does. It makes for
  a mildly enjoyable, yet rather hollow experience. <em>Belong</em> is a decent
  record, but it’s also one of my personal disappointments of 2017.</p></div>

review: "This is my first time in experiencing the sound of San Fermin, and it
  has proved to be an interesting record for me for a number of reasons.
  *Belong* doesn’t shy away from openly revealing its tricks and influences.
  This makes it feel instantly accessible and comprehendible, but at times also
  causes certain tracks to feel formulaic, and a little too familiar to what can
  be heard in mainstream popular music. Ellis Ludwig-Leone has done excellently
  to create polished, dreamy sonics that are made current with elements of
  electronic music. The flow of *Belong* is well orchestrated: it pleases the
  ears throughout, and never feeling like it’s dragging. However, I found myself
  halted from any real connection with San Fermin’s voice due to hollow lyrical
  concepts, saturated vocal hooks and unimaginative melodies — the harsh truth
  to my ears. It’s worth noting that there was nothing outside of this that
  particularly bothered me, or even stopped me from enjoying it. My issue is
  that there is very little to entice me in revisiting the record. I don’t see
  *Belong* lasting long in my memory, but there may be something for you here."

review: I can’t help but be disappointed. From their distinctive, suspenseful
  debut, to their [follow up
  album](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/san-fermin-jackrabbit/>) that didn’t
  quite hit the same mark, and now to *Belong*, I’m continuously finding less to
  love in San Fermin. Besides a few standout tracks, a lot of the work here
  feels homogenised. I can draw easy comparisons between these tracks and other
  mainstream pop tracks (“Better Company” is a Calvin Harris track sanitised for
  Radio 2) and that wasn’t something I would think about doing in previous
  releases. Drained of its drama, its strings softened and horns stifled,
  *Belong* really has lost a great deal of the charm that San Fermin had
  initially brought to the table. With that said, comparisons with old material
  can be unhelpful and unfair. *Belong* has some beautiful vocal moments, with
  the opening track, fittingly named “Open”, featuring both angelic washes of
  vocals and sweet vocal harmony. For whatever reason, those tracks with female
  lead vocals land better than those with male lead vocals, and are often filled
  to the brim with energy and warmth. In terms of instrumentation, there are
  still some outings for the horn section; “Oceanica” erupts into a cacophony of
  horns after a more electronic arrangement lays the groundwork, and “Happiness
  Will Ruin This Place” is a lighter track to close, which leaves a good lasting
  impression. The diamond in the rough here though is “Dead” – a noisy,
  fidgeting stonker. Giving the female vocalists a chance to give it some welly,
  and the horns and strings some space to make a noise, this track is by far my
  favourite here. It’s a tense, suspense-filled, dynamic drama that makes me
  wish for more, and the rest of the album really should’ve followed its
  example. It’s nice to hear more material from San Fermin, but I’ll be
  returning to previous material before I return to this.
