Drawn with Pilot Vball black ink pen on paper, the vinyl groove is a single uninterrupted line. I was sharing a flat with [Thomas Ashby](<https://audioxide.com/interviews/thomas-ashby/>) at the time. It was because of this drawing that he suggested we work together on the artwork for his *Backlash* EP, which we did.
