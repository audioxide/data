  Clark achieves a distinct sound that can only be described as some sort of
  melodic computer malfunction, her sweet voice combining effortlessly with
  jittery guitars, shifty synthesisers, and noise-influenced textures that are
  welcoming rather than challenging.

review: Avoiding the pitfalls that can often appear on art-rock records, St.
  Vincent’s self-titled album is a confident release that sparkles with
  peculiarity, but steers away from pretension. In capturing the middle ground
  between passion and precision, Annie Clark achieves a distinct sound that can
  only be described as some sort of melodic computer malfunction, her sweet
  voice combining effortlessly with jittery guitars, shifty synthesisers, and
  noise-influenced textures that are welcoming rather than challenging. Clark
  retains her status as being one of the most distinctive guitarists in modern
  music, and it comes to no surprise that the majority of the hits on *St.
  Vincent* contain those wonderfully condensed guitar fragments that make her
  such a unique performer. However, whilst there is a lot to admire about the
  album, proceedings do unfortunately get a little wobbly towards the end. It’s
  undoubtedly a tight record, flowing effortlessly from track to track, but when
  the first half is crammed with so many good ideas, the following portion ends
  up feeling rather uninspired in comparison. Aside from the poignant closer,
  there isn’t a single moment that gets close to being as captivating as the
  vocal hooks on “Digital Witness” and “Birth in Reverse”, with “Every Tear
  Disappears” being a particularly notable dud. That being said, there are
  enough positive consistencies that run through the album to warrant the
  universal praise that was rewarded upon release in 2014, and the high points
  do certainly soar to tremendous heights. Overall, *St. Vincent* is an
  infectious work by an artist that we should absolutely be cherishing, but it’s
  the opening twenty-three minutes that really shine.

review: Having been a casual follower of St. Vincent’s music for years prior to
  this release, it was a real treat to hear the various pieces of Annie Clark’s
  potential fall together with such aplomb. Channelling a vibrant mixture of art
  rock convention and lively initiative, *St. Vincent *is a crackling treat for
  the senses and the sensibilities. Its surprisingly grounded underlying
  structure allows for all manner of fuzzy, distorted hell to break loose in a
  way that never feels gratuitous or abrasive. The enigmatic gorgeousness of
  Clark’s voice — a quality shared with her guitar work — is utterly enticing,
  and breaths a soul into the distinctly modern machinery of which much of the
  album is comprised. It’s a lovely juxtaposition. For every audacious call in
  the vein of “Birth in Reverse” or “Rattlesnake” there is a gentle response of
  a “Prince Johnny” or “Severed Crossed Fingers”; and each track manages a
  unique inflection. The effects of Clark’s recent collaboration with David
  Byrne on *Love This Giant* are evident, but they are but one of a series of
  influences that rarely outstay their welcome. There are a couple of bum notes
  in the final third of *St. Vincent* that I think hold the album back from the
  highest drawer, but they are minor blemishes on a work that will likely be
  held in the highest esteem when people reflect on notable cultural products of
  the 2010s.

review: To my surprise, as a new comer to St. Vincent, this eponymous album is
  filled with interesting, suitably distorted, electronic timbres. Buzzes, whirs
  and beeps cover the album, accompanying simple but satisfying beats and catchy
  guitar riffs. Over all this, Anne Clark’s distinctive vocal melodies pull the
  whole album together. There are clear throwbacks throughout to the 80s, with
  Clark citing many artists of the period as her own influences, making for
  memorable, upbeat tracks. The singles taken from the album demonstrate that
  there was a clear bias of upbeat tracks towards the former half of the album,
  the latter half settling down into a mix of experimentation and downtempo
  electronica. While this is by no means a deal breaker for the album, it can
  make the tracklist feel a little lopsided. With that said, the closer,
  “Severed Crossed Fingers”, is one of the finer examples of this downtempo
  electronica (with twinges of country!) and allows Clark’s vocals and guitar to
  shine through. Certainly an album I shall return to fully in the future.
