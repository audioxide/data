  *The Downward Spiral* serves as a reminder that music can often be the purest form of human expression. As a work of art, Reznor takes us into the deepest and darkest places of the human psyche, questioning the importance of control and the relevance of religion; all the while depicting the bleak dehumanization of society and its effect on ones individuality. 
  
  Reznor set a benchmark in the industrial rock genre, whilst simultaneously providing a form of therapy for millions of angst-filled listeners who inevitably soaked up his devastating portrayal of nihilism. In hindsight the record was truly ahead of its time - even today it feels only the slightest bit aged - and the innovative production techniques used across the album are still mimicked to this day. 
  
  *The Downward Spiral* is a masterpiece, a work of art that has changed my life and will most likely stay with me forever. Who knew despair was so alluring?

  There’s so much emotion in this album, the themes are pretty dark to begin with and powerful instrumentation and the intricate composition really produces, at least from me, a huge amount of empathy. While I always rush over lyrics, some of the lyrics in the album are intense, veiled, and simply striking. It’s been a slow burner though, it’s certainly not a ‘happy’ album, but one that I’ve really grown to love.
