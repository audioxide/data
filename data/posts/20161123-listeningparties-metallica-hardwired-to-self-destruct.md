This is part of [a series](<http://audioxide.com/listeningparties/>) in which two or more members of the Audioxide team listen to an album for the first time. Any instances of interest or insight are purely coincidental.
![metallicababble2](<2016/11/metallicababble2-1024x547.jpg> =680x363)** [“Hardwired”]**
**André<br>
**Riffs.
**Fred<br>
**And things being hit hard and fast.
**André<br>
**There will always be a space for that<br>
 I’ve heard this one, I think it was the promo single or something
**Fred<br>
**It’s quite a punchy little number, I suppose.<br>
 Gets your attention.
**André<br>
**It works in the same way Limerent Death did for me<br>
 The Dillinger opener
**Fred<br>
**Yeah, similar vibe.<br>
 Metallica have this uncanny knack for sounding accessible, though.<br>
 You know how grating I find most hardcore metal music.
**André**<br>
 I think it’s mostly down to the production<br>
 It’s not too suffocating is it
**Fred**<br>
 It’s almost cuddly.<br>
 Cuddly metal.
**André**<br>
 And Hetfield’s vocals are kinda tame in contrast to other, more punishing metal vocalists<br>
 ‘Cuddly metal’ is likely to upset Metallica fans as a tagline<br>
 Thus I approve
**Fred**<br>
 Haha, good.
**[“Atlas, Rise!”]**
**Fred**<br>
 I like this.
**André**<br>
 I dig it.<br>
 You know what you’re gonna get with them<br>
 Two tracks in, and it seems like a good Metallica fix
**Fred**<br>
 Definitely.<br>
 This sound would fit in on the very finest Tony Hawk game soundtrack.
**André**<br>
 Radical, man.
**Fred**<br>
 This is really well put together.<br>
 We’re over five minutes into the track and it doesn’t feel it at all.
**André**<br>
 You’re right, fucking hell.<br>
 I hadn’t noticed<br>
 Atlas, Rise! – good job<br>
 If I were to be ultra-critical, the sound is perhaps so clean<br>
 The riffs are kickass – but the production is pretty safe. Tame, even
**[“Now That We’re Dead”]**
**Fred**<br>
 Well, to that point, this groove has a lot more grit to it.<br>
 Though generally I agree.<br>
 But that’s more of a relief to me than it is to you.
**André**<br>
 Haha, different stokes.
**Fred**<br>
 Ironically, because they don’t do that horrible death growl thing I actually would like to hear a rawer sound.<br>
 This track with a bit more snarl would be a proper rocker.
**André**<br>
 I don’t think it helps that Lars Ulrich is drumming with his usual uninspiring finesse<br>
 It’s fine, and the snare fills are impressive, it’s just predictable
**Fred**<br>
 Ah, I like it. And how original can a band really sound after 35 years?
**André**<br>
 I guess that’s the ultimate question, isn’t it?<br>
 Don’t get me wrong – this is the best they’ve sounded for fucking ages
**Fred**<br>
 I get the impression this is like getting an old favourite dish.<br>
 I will say, the album length did catch my eye going into this.<br>
 Let’s see how indulgent I am in an hour.
**André**<br>
 Oh. It’s almost 90 minutes.<br>
 I’m calling it: we considerably enjoy disc one, and become irritated half way through disc two
**Fred**<br>
 It’s all right. When that happens we can just talk about Harry Kane for a bit.
**André**<br>
 \*swoon\*
**[“Moth Into Flame”]**
**Fred**<br>
 This track is also listenable and fun. Who’d have thought?<br>
 Long tracks so far, opener aside. Not that they feel it.
**André**<br>
 So far, every song has warranted its length<br>
 It’s not often we get to say that, as the time police
**Fred**<br>
 Give it… time.
**[“Dream No More”]**
**Fred<br>
**This feels a tad milked.
**André**<br>
 Yeah. Slight change of pace here with Dream No More
**Fred**<br>
 There we go.<br>
 Ooh, I like this.
**André**<br>
 Excellent groove
**Fred**<br>
 That’s as far as my insights will go.
**André**<br>
 Sometimes that’s all that needs to be said.<br>
 Do we just have a soft spot for old-timers or something?<br>
 This year in particular. Bowie, Nick Cave, Swans, now Metallica<br>
 Radiohead, obviously
**Fred**<br>
 I think we have a soft spot for old-timers who walk the walk.<br>
 In the grand scheme of things, they usually don’t.<br>
 The old-timers who didn’t die have had a fine 2016, I think.
**André**<br>
 Well, one generation had to didn’t they
**Fred**<br>
 That’s true. The young blood have offered up a whole lot of tripe.<br>
 So hearing some geezers rocking out super tight is a welcome thing.
**[“Halo on Fire”]**
**Fred**<br>
 Eight minutes of power chords incoming.
**André**<br>
 We’ve come to the end of first disc already?<br>
 It’s flown by<br>
 Ooh, nice. This is reminiscent of One
**Fred**<br>
 They’re changing up their sound plenty, to be fair to them.<br>
 Where there is sameyness I think it has more to do with the production than with the music.<br>
 As you were saying earlier.
**André**<br>
 Definitely
**Fred**<br>
 Digging the smoother vocals here.
**André**<br>
 Yeah I was gonna say, his tone suits these subtle cuts down to the ground<br>
 I have to say, this first disc has been pretty damn good<br>
 I don’t have many complaints
**Fred**<br>
 Likewise.<br>
 This is closing things out brilliantly as well.
**André**<br>
 I’ll admit I’m concerned that we still have another 45 minutes, however.
**Fred**<br>
 Same.<br>
 If they stopped here I’d be dead chuffed.<br>
 One of the fastest forty minutes of the year.
**André**<br>
 Yeah absolutely
**[“Confusion”]**
**Fred**<br>
 Chords? More like DISchords!<br>
 Not feeling this as much.
**André**<br>
 No<br>
 It’s alright, it’s lacking though<br>
 Those riffs feel messy too
**Fred**<br>
 The whole thing seems a bit sloppy by their standards.<br>
 But they’ve set a very high bar up to this point, to be fair.
**André**<br>
 That’s what I’m telling myself, in order to restrain myself from skipping it.
**Fred**<br>
 Two minutes to go.
**André**<br>
 Ok, if the album doesn’t let up, and continues at the same pace, it’s gonna feel very tiresome.<br>
 But if this 2nd side ends up containing more melodic cuts like Halo on Fire, we’ll be on to a winner<br>
 Confusion was not the best start, though.
**Fred**<br>
 First track to feel its length.<br>
 Let’s see what subtlety ManUNkind has up its sleeve.
**[“ManUNkind”]**
**André**<br>
 This is a great riff
**Fred**<br>
 This is more like it.<br>
 \*was<br>
 Ooh, \*is
**André**<br>
 Yeah this is TUBULAR
**Fred**<br>
 Muse wish they sounded like this these days.
**André**<br>
 I dig it. There’s an edge to this<br>
 That main riff has a real unusual quality to it
**Fred**<br>
 I will say though, because it keeps happening, that a lot of these intros feel a bit indulgent.<br>
 They keep getting away with it because they lead into something great.
**André**<br>
 Natural after 50 odd minutes of it<br>
 This is one of the best tracks though
**Fred**<br>
 This is rocking.
**André**<br>
 We can safely put Confusion on the ‘unnecessary’ list
**Fred**<br>
 For sure.
**André**<br>
 That riff is so damn funky<br>
 What a highlight
**Fred**<br>
 Poor thing’s sandwiched between two of the best songs as well.<br>
 Yeah, terrific.
**André**<br>
 I am such a sucker for a great riff
**Fred**<br>
 There’s no beating it.<br>
 The guitar sounds top as well.<br>
 You’re so going to learn this.
**André**<br>
 My Ibanez may be in Metallica mode for a couple of weeks, yeah.
**Fred**<br>
 I’ll never get tired of metal track names.<br>
 Never.
**[“Here Comes Revenge”]**
**Fred**<br>
 Throttling stuff, this.<br>
 Not letting up at all.<br>
 And I’m happy about it.
**André**<br>
 I’m feeling slight fatigue, if only because it’s been almost an hour<br>
 Really good hooks on this one though<br>
 I tell you what<br>
 For better or worse (though mostly better), this is far more focused than lots of this years major album drops too.
**Fred**<br>
 It is.<br>
 But being unfocused is en vogue at the moment.
**André**<br>
 Did you see Kanye walked off stage after 3 songs last night?
**Fred**<br>
 Nope. Why?
**André**<br>
 He had a rant about Jay-Z, Beyonce, Clinton. Then walked off.<br>
 He needs help
**Fred**<br>
 Haha, this outro blitz is fucking great.<br>
 I’ll have to have a look.<br>
 Do you think we’re the only ones who can?
**André**<br>
 Maybe.<br>
 That or he needs his dose of Metallica
**Fred**<br>
 There’s a good one going round.<br>
 They’re three tracks away from one of the best releases of the year.
**[“Am I Savage?”]**
**André**<br>
 Another solid groove here.<br>
 Proper headbanger
**Fred**<br>
 Nearly all the songs are over five minutes, and they’re getting away with it.<br>
 We’re surely over an hour in at this point.
**André**<br>
 We are yeah<br>
 I wouldn’t say it hasn’t felt like an hour, because it has, but it’s been an hour well spent. So far, so good.
**Fred**<br>
 Agreed.<br>
 The opening disc flew by, though.<br>
 The length catches up with it on side two.
**André**<br>
 No band would completely get away with a 90 minute album I reckon
**Fred**<br>
 I think you’re right.<br>
 But fair play to these guys, they’re having a good old go at it.
**[“Murder One”]**
**Fred**<br>
 Really authoritative riff on this track.
**André**<br>
 We can establish this is one of the more accomplished releases of the year<br>
 But maybe some fine-tuning and editing would have made it something even better
**Fred**<br>
 Perhaps, but then there’s only one superfluous track.<br>
 There’s almost too much goodness for its own good.
**André**<br>
 Yeah haha, bizarrely<br>
 I think things have more room to make an impact when they are cut shorter<br>
 Either way, this certainly gets a thumbs up from me
**Fred**<br>
 Same. Glad we’ve listened to it.<br>
 This is a ‘show those ruffians how it’s done’ album if there ever was one.
**André**<br>
 Another solid tune, but I’m very almost done now
**[“Spit Out the Bone”]**
**Fred**<br>
 Well, good thing it’s the closer!
**André**<br>
 And it’s started fucking well
**Fred**<br>
 Christ, our top ten lists are going to be dominated by middle-aged men and dead people.
**André**<br>
 2016\.
**Fred**<br>
 What a year.
**André**<br>
 This reminds me of how the whole album started. All those 70 odd minutes ago<br>
 It’s gone full circle
**Fred**<br>
 Yeah, I like that.<br>
 And it has been quite the epic.<br>
 We didn’t even need to talk about Harry Kane.
**André**<br>
 Luckily for you
**Fred**<br>
 We’d need a NSFW tag.<br>
 Going out with a bang aren’t they.<br>
 Breathless.
**André**<br>
 Yeah. Good for them. This is good shit<br>
 I’m impressed, and I didn’t expect to be
**Fred**<br>
 No. I thought you’d suggested it so we could be smarmy and all that.<br>
 Then I learnt it’s meant to be great.
**André**<br>
 I was almost hoping we’d get the opportunity<br>
 But yes, it’s turned out to be rather good<br>
 Well.<br>
 Fuck you, Metallica
