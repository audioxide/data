title: "&#8220;Show those ruffians how it&#8217;s done&#8221; &#8211; André and Fred listen to Metallica"
author: admin

This is part of [a series](<listeningparties/>) in which two or more members of the Audioxide team listen to an album for the first time. Any instances of interest or insight are purely coincidental.

 [“Hardwired”]

**André**
Riffs.

**Fred**
And things being hit hard and fast.

**André**
There will always be a space for that
I’ve heard this one, I think it was the promo single or something

**Fred**
It’s quite a punchy little number, I suppose.
Gets your attention.

**André**
It works in the same way Limerent Death did for me
The Dillinger opener

**Fred**
Yeah, similar vibe.
Metallica have this uncanny knack for sounding accessible, though.
You know how grating I find most hardcore metal music.

**André**
I think it’s mostly down to the production
It’s not too suffocating is it

**Fred**
It’s almost cuddly.
Cuddly metal.

**André**
And Hetfield’s vocals are kinda tame in contrast to other, more punishing metal vocalists
‘Cuddly metal’ is likely to upset Metallica fans as a tagline
Thus I approve

**Fred**
Haha, good.

[“Atlas, Rise!”]

**Fred**
I like this.

**André**
I dig it.
You know what you’re gonna get with them
Two tracks in, and it seems like a good Metallica fix

**Fred**
Definitely.
This sound would fit in on the very finest Tony Hawk game soundtrack.

**André**
Radical, man.

**Fred**
This is really well put together.
We’re over five minutes into the track and it doesn’t feel it at all.

**André**
You’re right, fucking hell.
I hadn’t noticed
Atlas, Rise! – good job
If I were to be ultra-critical, the sound is perhaps so clean
The riffs are kickass – but the production is pretty safe. Tame, even

[“Now That We’re Dead”]

**Fred**
Well, to that point, this groove has a lot more grit to it.
Though generally I agree.
But that’s more of a relief to me than it is to you.

**André**
Haha, different stokes.

**Fred**
Ironically, because they don’t do that horrible death growl thing I actually would like to hear a rawer sound.
This track with a bit more snarl would be a proper rocker.

**André**
I don’t think it helps that Lars Ulrich is drumming with his usual uninspiring finesse
It’s fine, and the snare fills are impressive, it’s just predictable

**Fred**
Ah, I like it. And how original can a band really sound after 35 years?

**André**
I guess that’s the ultimate question, isn’t it?
Don’t get me wrong – this is the best they’ve sounded for fucking ages

**Fred**
I get the impression this is like getting an old favourite dish.
I will say, the album length did catch my eye going into this.
Let’s see how indulgent I am in an hour.

**André**
Oh. It’s almost 90 minutes.
I’m calling it: we considerably enjoy disc one, and become irritated half way through disc two

**Fred**
It’s all right. When that happens we can just talk about Harry Kane for a bit.

**André**
*swoon*

[“Moth Into Flame”]

**Fred**
This track is also listenable and fun. Who’d have thought?
Long tracks so far, opener aside. Not that they feel it.

**André**
So far, every song has warranted its length
It’s not often we get to say that, as the time police

**Fred**
Give it… time.

[“Dream No More”]

**Fred**
This feels a tad milked.

**André**
Yeah. Slight change of pace here with Dream No More

**Fred**
There we go.
Ooh, I like this.

**André**
Excellent groove

**Fred**
That’s as far as my insights will go.

**André**
Sometimes that’s all that needs to be said.
Do we just have a soft spot for old-timers or something?
This year in particular. Bowie, Nick Cave, Swans, now Metallica
Radiohead, obviously

**Fred**
I think we have a soft spot for old-timers who walk the walk.
In the grand scheme of things, they usually don’t.
The old-timers who didn’t die have had a fine 2016, I think.

**André**
Well, one generation had to didn’t they

**Fred**
That’s true. The young blood have offered up a whole lot of tripe.
So hearing some geezers rocking out super tight is a welcome thing.

[“Halo on Fire”]

**Fred**
Eight minutes of power chords incoming.

**André**
We’ve come to the end of first disc already?
It’s flown by
Ooh, nice. This is reminiscent of One

**Fred**
They’re changing up their sound plenty, to be fair to them.
Where there is sameyness I think it has more to do with the production than with the music.
As you were saying earlier.

**André**
Definitely

**Fred**
Digging the smoother vocals here.

**André**
Yeah I was gonna say, his tone suits these subtle cuts down to the ground
I have to say, this first disc has been pretty damn good
I don’t have many complaints

**Fred**
Likewise.
This is closing things out brilliantly as well.

**André**
I’ll admit I’m concerned that we still have another 45 minutes, however.

**Fred**
Same.
If they stopped here I’d be dead chuffed.
One of the fastest forty minutes of the year.

**André**
Yeah absolutely

[“Confusion”]

**Fred**
Chords? More like DISchords!
Not feeling this as much.

**André**
No
It’s alright, it’s lacking though
Those riffs feel messy too

**Fred**
The whole thing seems a bit sloppy by their standards.
But they’ve set a very high bar up to this point, to be fair.

**André**
That’s what I’m telling myself, in order to restrain myself from skipping it.

**Fred**
Two minutes to go.

**André**
Ok, if the album doesn’t let up, and continues at the same pace, it’s gonna feel very tiresome.
But if this 2nd side ends up containing more melodic cuts like Halo on Fire, we’ll be on to a winner
Confusion was not the best start, though.

**Fred**
First track to feel its length.
Let’s see what subtlety ManUNkind has up its sleeve.

[“ManUNkind”]

**André**
This is a great riff

**Fred**
This is more like it.
*was
Ooh, *is

**André**
Yeah this is TUBULAR

**Fred**
Muse wish they sounded like this these days.

**André**
I dig it. There’s an edge to this
That main riff has a real unusual quality to it

**Fred**
I will say though, because it keeps happening, that a lot of these intros feel a bit indulgent.
They keep getting away with it because they lead into something great.

**André**
Natural after 50 odd minutes of it
This is one of the best tracks though

**Fred**
This is rocking.

**André**
We can safely put Confusion on the ‘unnecessary’ list

**Fred**
For sure.

**André**
That riff is so damn funky
What a highlight

**Fred**
Poor thing’s sandwiched between two of the best songs as well.
Yeah, terrific.

**André**
I am such a sucker for a great riff

**Fred**
There’s no beating it.
The guitar sounds top as well.
You’re so going to learn this.

**André**
My Ibanez may be in Metallica mode for a couple of weeks, yeah.

**Fred**
I’ll never get tired of metal track names.
Never.

[“Here Comes Revenge”]

**Fred**
Throttling stuff, this.
Not letting up at all.
And I’m happy about it.

**André**
I’m feeling slight fatigue, if only because it’s been almost an hour
Really good hooks on this one though
I tell you what
For better or worse (though mostly better), this is far more focused than lots of this years major album drops too.

**Fred**
It is.
But being unfocused is en vogue at the moment.

**André**
Did you see Kanye walked off stage after 3 songs last night?

**Fred**
Nope. Why?

**André**
He had a rant about Jay-Z, Beyonce, Clinton. Then walked off.
He needs help

**Fred**
Haha, this outro blitz is fucking great.
I’ll have to have a look.
Do you think we’re the only ones who can?

**André**
Maybe.
That or he needs his dose of Metallica

**Fred**
There’s a good one going round.
They’re three tracks away from one of the best releases of the year.

[“Am I Savage?”]

**André**
Another solid groove here.
Proper headbanger

**Fred**
Nearly all the songs are over five minutes, and they’re getting away with it.
We’re surely over an hour in at this point.

**André**
We are yeah
I wouldn’t say it hasn’t felt like an hour, because it has, but it’s been an hour well spent. So far, so good.

**Fred**
Agreed.
The opening disc flew by, though.
The length catches up with it on side two.

**André**
No band would completely get away with a 90 minute album I reckon

**Fred**
I think you’re right.
But fair play to these guys, they’re having a good old go at it.

[“Murder One”]

**Fred**
Really authoritative riff on this track.

**André**
We can establish this is one of the more accomplished releases of the year
But maybe some fine-tuning and editing would have made it something even better

**Fred**
Perhaps, but then there’s only one superfluous track.
There’s almost too much goodness for its own good.

**André**
Yeah haha, bizarrely
I think things have more room to make an impact when they are cut shorter
Either way, this certainly gets a thumbs up from me

**Fred**
Same. Glad we’ve listened to it.
This is a ‘show those ruffians how it’s done’ album if there ever was one.

**André**
Another solid tune, but I’m very almost done now

[“Spit Out the Bone”]

**Fred**
Well, good thing it’s the closer!

**André**
And it’s started fucking well

**Fred**
Christ, our top ten lists are going to be dominated by middle-aged men and dead people.

**André**
2016.

**Fred**
What a year.

**André**
This reminds me of how the whole album started. All those 70 odd minutes ago
It’s gone full circle

**Fred**
Yeah, I like that.
And it has been quite the epic.
We didn’t even need to talk about Harry Kane.

**André**
Luckily for you

**Fred**
We’d need a NSFW tag.
Going out with a bang aren’t they.
Breathless.

**André**
Yeah. Good for them. This is good shit
I’m impressed, and I didn’t expect to be

**Fred**
No. I thought you’d suggested it so we could be smarmy and all that.
Then I learnt it’s meant to be great.

**André**
I was almost hoping we’d get the opportunity
But yes, it’s turned out to be rather good
Well.
Fuck you, Metallica
