summary: There’s a Riot Going On is neither immersive nor memorable. The sonic
  palette is murky and the songwriting is lax. Any time the group stumble onto a
  passable bass line or soothing melody they run it into the ground in some sort
  of slow motion indie panic.

review: By the time I had finished my first listen of *There’s a Riot Going On*,
  I had already forgotten about it. As I would any other album, I gave it the
  benefit the doubt, assumed it was a grower, and hours later delved back into
  its soft, smooth aesthetic. This process has been repeated a number of times,
  and I still don’t have much to say about it. As the title insinuates, Yo La
  Tengo offer their listeners a subdued space to unwind whilst the outside world
  continues to crumble. An admirable ambition, and a welcomed approach in
  theory, but the execution is underwhelming. *There’s a Riot Going On*
  essentially consists of gentle guitar strumming, indistinct vocals, and
  floating ambient pulsations. I find the ambient passages more engaging than
  the majority of actual songs, which is never a good sign. That’s not to
  discredit the impact of “Shortwave” — as it’s rather divine — but rather to
  expose the feebleness of the overall experience. Nothing sticks. The
  songwriting isn’t bad, it’s probably even quite good, but the performances are
  unbelievably lifeless. *There’s a Riot Going On* has the smooth, patient
  aesthetic of a folksy wonder, but the songs themselves have been criminally
  overlooked. Whilst its sound is too pleasant to warrant any real displeasure,
  it’s unlikely that the record will make any sort of splash in the current of
  new releases. The truth is, it never stood a chance.

review: I can only assume *There’s a Riot Going On *was given its title as a
  joke. Listening to the album has been like trying to stay awake after a couple
  of days without sleep. As far as I can tell, Yo La Tengo decided to undertake
  a dreamy ambient rock project and lacked the restraint necessary to make it
  work. It isn’t bad. Instead it’s boring, which might be even worse. *There’s a
  Riot Going On *is neither immersive nor memorable. The sonic palette is murky
  and the songwriting is lax. Any time the group stumble onto a passable bass
  line or soothing melody they run it into the ground in some sort of slow
  motion indie panic. I had no idea 3-minute songs could last so long. There’s
  the makings of a decent ambient work here, but the execution has been
  thoroughly botched. Clock-watching is one of the worst possible responses you
  can have to an album, and *There’s a Riot Going On *inspires it in spades. Any
  promise it had is lost beneath the surface of a shoegaze mire.

review: I don’t take any pleasure in lambasting Yo La Tengo’s latest release.
  Listening through *There’s a Riot Going On*, you’re met with warm, often
  calming instrumentals which are easy on the ear but don’t feature a lot of
  progression. It does well at setting an atmosphere and works best as
  background music, but the fact that the record does little more than that
  exposes its flaws. “Esportes Casual” would function perfectly as elevator
  music as it noodles around above a chord sequence throughout its play time,
  and while that may’ve been the intention of the track, it’s difficult not to
  see a similar trend across the tracklist. Tracks like “Shortwave”, a far more
  graceful and ethereal song, definitely play better as they verge closer to an
  ambient soundscape, than the awkward, in-between style that the majority of
  the album settles on. There’s unfortunately not a lot more I can say for
  *There’s a Riot Going On*. Stick it on during dinner and you’ll probably find
  a lot to like, with some notable moments and enjoyable moods to pique your
  interest. But if you concentrate on the music, you’re unlikely to uncover much
  more of note, and that feels like a critical element of a good album that
  inhibits *There’s a Riot Going On* from reaching greater heights.
