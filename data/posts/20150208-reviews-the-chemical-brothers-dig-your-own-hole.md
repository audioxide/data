artworkCredit: was designed by design agency Negativespace, which also designed the duo’s logo. Negativespace co-founder Anthony Sweeney said the trippy, quasi-psychedelic logo was on the ‘crazy’ end of the spectrum of ideas they came up with, calling it the ‘antithesis of what we thought of as good typography at the time.’

pullquote: Fine basslines
summary: Once the more textured songs rear their heads the whole album falls together a little better. The last few tracks are top notch.

blurb: The Chemical Brothers’ second album is likely to please a number of electric tastes. It seldom rises above a good beat, but then it doesn’t need to.

  Despite my love and appreciation for electronic music, *Dig Your Own Hole* is not an album I personally connect with too much. My favourite tracks are those that are less driven by a beat and focus instead on interesting melodies and textural layers.

  It’s certainly an acquired taste, but once I got over the hump I actually quite enjoyed the album. The allure of dance tracks is totally lost on me (which is more my problem than the album’s), but once the more textured songs rear their heads the whole album falls together a little better. The ending portion mellowed out my initial irritation. The last few tracks are top notch.

  I think it had some interesting influences, some nice basslines, and I will be returning to a fair few tracks. It’s not my favourite album of theirs from the ’90s, or in general, though.
