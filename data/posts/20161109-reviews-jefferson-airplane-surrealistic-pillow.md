review: <div class="_d97"><p><em>Surrealistic Pillow</em> was a pioneering piece
  of psychedelic folk-rock, filled to the brim with creativity. It remains a
  staple of the genre today, feeling as fresh and vibrant now as it did in 1967,
  and stands as tall as the finest works of the same era by The Rolling Stones
  and <a href="reviews/the-beatles-revolver/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Beatles</a>. The music is so accomplished,
  and so varied, that it sounds like a wonderful montage of the ’60s. Jefferson
  Airplane had an ear for dynamics that other bands had yet to expose, which
  enhanced the songwriting no end. The two hits, “Somebody to Love” and “White
  Rabbit”, have become increasingly discernible with age, standing as fitting
  representations of the colourful side of that decade. It’s no coincidence that
  these are the two tracks sung by Grace Slick — her vocal performances are
  absolutely astonishing, and continue to make a stunning impact. Slick’s
  illustrious vibrato carries a tremendous presence that has yet to be matched.
  However, it’s not the sole reason for these tracks’ perpetual success. “White
  Rabbit” in particular is outstanding, a masterful piece of hypnotic
  psychedelia that has notably reaped its reputation through numerous uses in <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcawX4ORU8k" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">modern</a>, and <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZTsYYHCYGY" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">not so modern</a> culture. However, <em>Surrealistic
  Pillow</em>’s quality goes far beyond its hits. “Comin’ Back to Me” is a
  thoroughly gorgeous love song that takes its time, yet has a powerful, tugging
  weight attached to it. “Embryonic Journey” is a beautiful instrumental that
  evokes peace and harmony and, rather poignantly, ends all too soon. There are
  quirks too, like the Beatles-flavoured “My Best Friend”, and the wonderful
  closer “Plastic Fantastic Lover”. Not everything pays off entirely, and the
  songwriting occasionally shows signs of age, but <em>Surrealistic Pillow
  </em>remains&nbsp;cohesive enough to be a well-rounded experience. Almost 50
  years on, and it’s still one of the greatest psychedelic folk rock albums out
  there.</p></div>

review: You get the full Summer of Love package with *Surrealistic Pillow*.
  Searing, mind-bending psychedelic odysseys sit side by side with spectacularly
  sappy lovey-dovey numbers, and almost everything is top notch. The music’s
  folky, rubbery psychedelia is of its time, but in a way that’s completely
  authoritative. It’s a bit of a ground zero album. Once you’re familiar with
  Jefferson Airplane’s sound you start hearing it all over the place. It’s a
  wonder the songs complement each other as well as they do, frankly. They soar
  from the realm of The Mamas & The Papas to [The Jimi Hendrix
  Experience](<reviews/the-jimi-hendrix-experience-electric-ladyland/>)
  without batting an eyelid, and they nail it. Everyone shows up. In returning
  to the album I was surprised to be reminded that Grace Slick only sings lead
  vocals on two tracks (“Somebody to Love” and “White Rabbit”). Her presence is
  larger than that. Her voice is storming, and integral to the group’s aura. As
  strong as the rest of the album often is, it’s Slick who ultimately steals the
  show. This works in *Surrealistic Pillow*’s favour, though. Just when the
  serene threatens to become dozy, she wrenches you to the heights, and you want
  to start all over again. This is a truly seductive listen, fit for just about
  any loose thoughts. Whatever floats your boat, man.

review: "It’s hard not to be at all aware of Jefferson Airplane, but after
  listening to their second release, *Surrealistic Pillow*, I think I’ve found a
  new discography that I need to delve into. With a tracklist that explores a
  lot of different styles synonymous with the ’60s, and over half the tracks
  individually leaving their own legacy in pop culture even today, you’d be
  forgiven for mistaking this release as a “best of” or compilation album.
  Instead, *Surrealistic Pillow* is an album from a band at the top of their
  game. Grace Slick provides now iconic vocals on “Somebody to Love” and “White
  Rabbit”, the former a reverberating rock canter while the latter is a
  tempered, twisting, haunting track that simmers for a minute and a half before
  boiling over during the final moments. In contrast, “My Best Friend” sounds
  far closer to an early Beatles sound of the early 60s, whilst “Embryonic
  Journey”, an entirely instrumental acoustic guitar piece, takes a lot of cues
  from classical guitar music. Jorma Kaukonen provides some great guitar work
  across the album, particularly in the satisfying solo in “Somebody to Love”.
  Looking at the lesser known tracks, there are definitely some new favourites
  to be found by those only familiar with the singles. “How Do You Feel” is a
  lovely, light track which breezes by, and “She Has Funny Cars” is a lively
  opener that mixes interesting influences of big band drums with crunchy
  guitars. One key characteristic of *Surrealistic Pillow* that impresses me is
  the length: with most tracks clocking in at around 3 minutes and an overall
  play time of 34 minutes, this album could feel a little light on material, but
  each track is well formed and developed, and does what it’s set out to
  achieve. No hanging about, and never outstaying their welcome. It’s refreshing
  to listen to, especially given some of the [new
  releases](<reviews/james-blake-the-colour-in-anything/>)
  [we’ve reviewed](<reviews/swans-the-glowing-man/>)[this
  year](<reviews/the-avalanches-wildflower/>). With all
  that said, the heavy exploration of style can sometimes make the tracklist
  feel like it’s held together by a thread, and while the highlights are very
  enjoyable to listen to, the mid-section of the album does lose the pace a
  little. Overall, this is a stonking album, and I’ll certainly return to it."
