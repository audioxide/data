pullquote: Amazingly catchy riffs
summary: Without the raw energy of Surfer Rosa and cohesiveness of Doolittle, Bossanova is simply a solid album from a remarkable band.
week: 1
blurb: Our first ever review. Reads like it too. In any case, the album can certainly boast a groove, but it lacks the edge of Pixies' best work.

  Without the raw energy of *Surfer Rosa* and cohesiveness of [*Doolittle*](/reviews/pixies-doolittle/), *Bossanova* is simply a solid album from a remarkable band. By no means their best work, but an enjoyable listen nonetheless (even if a few tracks do drift by).

  I found a lot of *Bossanova* to be quite forgettable. There is a handful of good tracks, but the album as a whole fails to build up a head of steam. It isn’t bad by any means, though, and certainly merits a listen.

tracks:
  - Havalina
  - Is She Weird
  - Cecilia Ann

  Really my first proper introduction to Pixies and I really enjoyed it. If nothing else there are some amazingly catchy guitar riffs.
