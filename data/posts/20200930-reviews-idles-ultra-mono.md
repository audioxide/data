  [*Joy as an Act of Resistance*](/reviews/idles-joy-as-an-act-of-resistance/) was undoubtedly a highlight of 2018 for me. As IDLES always manage to do, it spoke volumes to the state of current affairs. Two years on and the world seems debatably worse. IDLES’ new record *Ultra Mono* acts not just as a further comment, but as a perfect release of anger, anxiety as well as love and kindness. It gets me fired up.

  Musically, *Ultra Mono* very much follows from where IDLES left off. The sheer abundance of rowdy riffs is superb. Each track offers a rhythmically powerful backdrop. The drums are pounding, guitars are bending, and bass is thumping. IDLES depart slightly from their formula with a few different guitar sounds – “Ne Touche Pas Moi” is a great show of this, and the feature from [Jehnny Beth](/reviews/jehnny-beth-to-love-is-to-live/) is great.

  The superbly executed music acts as backdrop from some unparalleled lyrics. “Model Village” speaks to me and my relationship with small town England in a big way , as I’m sure it does many people. Similarly tracks like “Reigns” offer a powerful punch of angst and anger, ironically music and lyrics are not ‘pulled back’ here, in any way. The following track “The Lover” is the yang to “Reigns” yin. It is a commanding riff with and unapologetically forceful message.

  There are some wonderful surprises in *Ultra Mono* too, with slower, [Joy Division](/reviews/joy-division-unknown-pleasures/)-esque songs like “A Hymn”. There is a huge amount of musical and lyrical ingenuity to enjoy here, with strong messages and jovial piss takes. One thing is for certain, Joe Talbot is the town crier, a megaphoned voice of a generation. IDLES bring a strong reckoning with *Ultra Mono* and I’m here in the crowd, killing them with kindness.

  IDLES are back, Terminator style. Screaming, thumping, taking names, *Ultra Mono* feels like a booster shot for the band; it’s nothing new, but more of a good thing is hard to argue with. Joe on fine form, as you’d expect, with tracks like “Model Village” providing a welcome fix. All in all the album listens like another brick thrown through the window of Bullshit Inc.

  For all its snarling punk credentials the album does seem a smidge comfortable compared to previous projects. Several tracks lack behind, and the production lacks a certain edge.  No instrumentals on *Ultra Mono* are as thunderous as “Divide & Conquer” or as biting as “Great”. There are shades of evolution – “Grounds” hits a kind of funk punk groove, for example – but the album captures a band feeling confident rather than enterprising. That’s fine by me.

  It’s a bit like a heavyweight boxer putting in a routine title defense. Yes he’s an adonis who could still rearrange your face with one arm tied behind his back, but he’s not quite as sharp or as chiseled or as powerful as when he’s in peak condition. *Ultra Mono* is a fine specimen of an album, but for me it isn’t IDLES’ best.
