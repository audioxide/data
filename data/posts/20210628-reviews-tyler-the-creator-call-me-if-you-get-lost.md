review: >-
  A decade on from Tyler, The Creator’s debut album, _CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST_ oozes confidence. Following a selection of stylised, cinematic teasers prior to its release, this latest release is a sample filled, feature-packed celebratory parade of Tyler’s career thus far.


  Off the back of his two previous studio albums, _CMIYGL_ bears a far closer resemblance to the mixtape style of early output like _Bastard_ and _Goblin_. DJ Drama acts as Tyler’s hypeman, working together to string a more varied collection of sounds throughout the tracklist. At times it feels as though Tyler’s flicking through his record box as samples remain relatively faithful to their original records and tracks take on characters of their own because of it.


  There’s more exploration here too. “SWEET / I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE” clicks into a reggae rocker for a spell, a jazz flute weaves its way through the album, and pairs up with a Lil Wayne feature in “HOT WIND BLOWS” to make for one of the more surprising collaborations here. But it’s “WUSYANAME” that’s become my earworm, with a laidback, sun-soaked H-Town sample and vocals that ride the instrumental expertly.


  Vocals remain true to form for Tyler, The Creator material. Gone are the shock tactics of the early years, but there’s still an edge to the delivery that feels closer to that era of his career. A lot of the playtime acts as a victory lap of sorts, “CORSO”, “RUNITUP” and “RISE!” are just a few of the tracks in which Tyler doesn’t hold back in celebrating his success and sticking it to the naysayers.


  _CMIYGL_ has been on my regular rotation since its release. It has a mix and match aesthetic of early era mixtapes with the maturity of the more recent output. Production is slick, lyrics are on form, and that combination makes for some of the best material Tyler’s ever released. But with more characterful, exploratory tracks comes a departure from the cohesive narratives we’ve seen in _Flower Boy_ or _IGOR_, and as a result, I don’t feel this album peaks above either of them. Nevertheless, this is a cracker of an album, and I’ll be certainly be coming back for more.
