pullquote: Laid back energy
summary: It has moments of quite profound Marley charm, but such peaks are
  matched by plateaus of what I can only describe as banal pleasantness. When I
  listen to Exodus I don't hear a great album; I hear a good album with a
  handful of iconic songs.

review: Following failed attempts of assassination, *Exodus* featured a
  rejuvenated Bob Marley who was seemingly just happy to still be alive. As a
  result, the mellow and reflective side of Marley set the tone, for better or
  worse. Whilst the energy of *Exodus* remained consistent in its laid-back
  approach, the content itself was divided into two halves. There’s certainly a
  parallel here — the nature of these split halves appropriately demonstrates
  the two sides of Bob Marley that he’s widely celebrated for; one of protest
  and demonstration, and the other of love, harmony and passion. To tread such a
  range of ground in a single record shows the level of power and influence Bob
  Marley had during recording. It floats by too easily for my taste, and a small
  selection of the tracks seem a little flat today, but it’s easy to see why
  *Exodus* is considered to be Bob Marley’s best work.

review: There’s a great deal to like about *Exodus*, but I don’t think the
  album’s overall quality matches up to its reputation. It has moments of quite
  profound Marley charm, but such peaks are matched by plateaus of what I can
  only describe as banal pleasantness. This is perhaps best represented by the
  disparity between the album’s two sides. “Exodus” aside, the first half is
  both very formulaic and very pleasant. Now obviously one would do pretty well
  to argue ‘formulaic’ is a vice in a genre like reggae, but *Exodus* reaches
  much higher peaks when it engages with a broader range of sounds and vocal
  deliveries. That all of the album’s hits are housed in its second side is not
  a coincidence. The contrast in vitality is night and day. Although one may
  quite reasonably argue such a contrast is reflective of the themes Bob Marley
  & the Wailers address over the course of the album, I don’t think that
  explains the first half being far less engaging. When I listen to *Exodus* I
  don’t hear a great album; I hear a good album with a handful of iconic songs.
  It feels slightly blasphemous giving it this score, but I cannot justify a
  higher one.

review: "*Exodus* is seen by many as a classic album of the 20th century, from
  an artist who played a major role in bringing reggae to a worldwide audience.
  Given that, the album has high praise and expectation to live up to. The
  signature rocking rhythm is definitely a quality I enjoy, but I found it
  sometimes led to tracks passing me by. As the album progresses, however, more
  variety can be found. The backing vocals, in particular, making some notable
  contributions to tracks, providing interesting harmonies in “Turn Your Lights
  Down Low” and making for a powerful chant towards the end of *Exodus*. While
  it’s a landmark album for many, I found it simply didn’t hit all the right
  notes with me, with some tracks not registering as different from the last.
  The three tracks which are now seen as Bob Marley classics are the tracks that
  stand out and make this album a good album, aside from those, I’m unsure how
  much of *Exodus* I will return to."
