  Squid’s debut has been characterised as ’weird and wonderful’ by some, which is as confusing as it is perturbing. In doing so, it confines Squid to the left of field, marking it as experimental and inaccessible. Instead, with Bright Green Field, Squid joins the likes of Black Country, New Road in producing something new and long overdue in guitar music. Far from weird or inaccessible, you’ll find a melting pot of influences you already know and love here.


  “Narrator” brings this melting pot to the front and centre. Blaring horns, agitated guitars, satisfying interplay between Martha Skye Murphy and Ollie Judge, and a whirlwind crescendo to bring the whole affair home make for a fantastic ride. Here and across the album, it’s easy to draw comparisons to some class acts. Strong tinges of Talking Heads and Radiohead flutter throughout, but Ollie Judge’s energetic, chatty vocal gives the whole album a punkish swagger. Combine that with a horn section that holds its own, marrying beautifully with synths in “Documentary Filmmaker” and adding a confident funk to opener, “G.S.K”, and it’s hard to keep my head from nodding along throughout.


  However, there are moments in the tracklist that do flirt with experimentation, potentially giving _some_ credence to the ’weird and wonderful’ assessment. “Boy Racers” diverts its latter half into an evolving haze, with ghostly voices and swerving noises. I could easily imagine these extended interludes would be tense, palpable moments in a live setting, and that’s an experience I’m raring to be a part of, but on record, they feel less suspenseful and more protracted than they should.


  Bright Green Field isn’t a jaw-dropping, top marks album right out the gate for Squid then, but that shouldn’t do it any disservice. Instead, this is a thoroughly enjoyable romp and another exciting debut for 2021. The band’s energy on record is sure to translate to a raucous live performance, and until I can catch that, I’ll certainly be returning to this record for more.
