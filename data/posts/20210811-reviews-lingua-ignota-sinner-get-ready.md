  Following the sheer intensity of 2019’s _Caligula_, I figured I knew what to expect coming into Lingua Ignota’s latest record. Whilst _Sinner Get Ready_ does retain the sonic juxtaposition of its predecessor, its arrangements are starker and more severe. I can say with absolute certainty that this is one of the most terrifying albums I’ve ever listened to. 


  A constant hum of anxiety is present throughout. Opening track “The Order of Spiritual Virgins” offers unparalleled levels of tension that keeps me on the very edge of my sanity, before throwing me off the edge with a sudden piano crash (perhaps the most effective jump-scare I’ve experienced in a piece of music). Make no mistake, _Sinner Get Ready_ is uncompromising, and very brutal indeed. Some listeners will struggle to see it through to the end, whereas others will eventually feel oddly comforted by its harshness. True to form, I am in the latter. I find it hauntingly beautiful.


  Many artists have conceived similar concepts to _Sinner Get Ready_ – muddled and contradictive relationships with religion – but it’s the execution that is so striking. Ignota’s voice is, in a word, astonishing. It grabs me in a similar way to Nick Cave, occasionally even Leonard Cohen. Her vocal range is one thing, but its the delivery that makes the music so devastatingly immersive. There is pure venom in her voice as she says ’take hold of my gentle axe, and split him open’ on “I Who Bend The Tall Grasses”, before shrieking ’I don’t give a fuck, just kill him/you have to, I’m not asking’. It’s genuinely horrifying, evoking emotions I haven’t felt listening to music before. Whilst I think the quality in the tracklist does fluctuate, _Sinner Get Ready_ is likely to stay with me for a long while. It’s like watching _The Exorcist_ for the first time.


  Musically, the album is comprised mostly of piano and strings, with moments of avant-garde folk that represent the unsettling realities of Christianity. There’s not a whole lot of melody to hold on to, but this isn’t exactly a classic sing-a-long affair. _Sinner Get Ready_ grabs you instead with vivid imagery: brutal depictions of ugly devotion, told by a voice so authentically traumatic that it could well be a psychological trigger for those unprepared. I’m unsure if it will go down as one of my very favourite records of the year, but it is most certainly an unforgettable piece of art. A monumental – and ghastly - achievement.
