**André<br>
**Well the album title is fitting.<br>
 Oh, wait. Is this turning into a house track?
**Fred<br>
**Good grief.<br>
 The roof on my house just blew off.
**André<br>
**That certainly took a turn haha.
**Fred<br>
**This is pretty fun.<br>
 Is it meant to be fun? I’ve never listened to Lorde before.
**André**<br>
 I’m not sure. Given her age, I assume so.
**Fred<br>
**This is fabulous.
**André**<br>
 The lyrics are a nice contrast to the happy-house tone of the instrumental.
**Fred<br>
**Very strong opener.
**[“Sober”]**
**André**<br>
 She has a very distinctive voice – it’s easy to see why such a fuss was made a few years ago.
**Fred<br>
**Yeah, husky.<br>
 Yet oddly smooth. Does it always have this near-conversational tone?
**André**<br>
 Yeah, but she can certainly soar too.
**Fred**<br>
 This hasn’t quite taken off like Green Light has.<br>
 Pleasant though.
**André**<br>
 Pleasant is the right word.
**[“Homemade Dynamite”]**
**André**<br>
 Her wordplay is fantastic. The delivery is stellar.
**Fred**<br>
 It’s all so measured.
**André**<br>
 I like how subdued the instrumental is.<br>
 Leaves her plenty of room.
**Fred**<br>
 Yeah, and the effect on the vocals is just right.<br>
 Gives it a glow.
**André**<br>
 Did she just make an explosion sound?<br>
 I think she did haha.
**Fred**<br>
 What a clever little hook the chorus has.
**André**<br>
 Yeah, this is good.<br>
 I’m impressed so far.
**[“The Louvre”]**
**André**<br>
 Moody pop is just right for a summer evening
**Fred**<br>
 Yeah, it’s a perfect fit.<br>
 I just like how slow it is. She’s confident enough not to throw a wall of noise at you, and rightly so.<br>
 She’s singing about over analyzing text messages and it’s great.<br>
 What’s going on?
**André**<br>
 There’s a level of restraint, agreed.<br>
 And it really benefits the mood.<br>
 Also displays an amazing level of maturity for a 20-year old.
**Fred**<br>
 Digging this fade out.
**[“Liability”]**
**André**<br>
 Seriously, the wordplay is seriously great.<br>
 What a lovely little ballad.
**Fred**<br>
 This is like a classy Disney tune or something.<br>
 This is so refreshingly weird.
**André**<br>
 I know.<br>
 That was really nice.<br>
 That one felt a lot more personal, too.
**Fred**<br>
 Yeah, very sweet
**[“Hard Feelings/Loveless”]**
**Fred**<br>
 This is building up really well.
**André**<br>
 Harmonies are wonderful.<br>
 This is shaping up to be a splendid listen.<br>
 There’s a real quirky, offbeat quality to some of these synths.<br>
 I like how it embraces some of the conventional qualities of pop, whilst throwing in some peculiar aspects too as a counterbalance.
**Fred**<br>
 Yeah. It’s like a successful version of those deliberately messy farces we’ve listened to.
**André**<br>
 You can tell there is influence from the likes of Bon Iver, yeah.<br>
 It’s way better than his record last year, frankly.
**Fred**<br>
 You mean 80n )v3r?
**André**<br>
 That one!
**[“Sober II”]**
**Fred**<br>
 Haha, a symphony. Of course.
**André**<br>
 There’s that classy Disney vibe again.
**Fred**<br>
 Is pop coming full circle to… sincerity?!
**André**<br>
 I wonder how well this will fare, commercially<br>
 Critically it’s doing wonders.<br>
 Ooh, that beat is ace.<br>
 Bass is sounding smooth as fuck on my hi-fi.
**Fred**<br>
 Suave isn’t it.<br>
 Production has been top notch.
**[“Writer in the Dark”]**
**Fred**<br>
 Most of the songs have been below 4 minutes, by the way. Nothing overcooked so far.
**André**<br>
 There’s that restraint again, yeah.<br>
 Her voice is the throbbing heart of this record. If she’s not careful, she’ll be one of THE voices of the incoming generation.<br>
 Only 20 years old and making records like this.<br>
 No wonder Bowie was excited about her.
**Fred**<br>
 The man knew a star when he saw one.
**[“Supercut”]**
**André**<br>
 There’s not been anything remotely house since the opener.<br>
 This could build to one though..<br>
 It’s sticking to the subdued.<br>
 Nice groove though.
**Fred**<br>
 Yeah, nice.<br>
 Oh there we go.
**André**<br>
 It got there in the end.
**Fred**<br>
 Haha, for like 8 seconds.<br>
 Her harmonies are so good.
**André**<br>
 Tease.<br>
 The producers did a wonderful job on this record.<br>
 Her included, it seems.
**[“Liability (Reprise)”]**
**André**<br>
 The whole thing has that vibe of a come-down from a glamorous party.<br>
 Written in the early hours of the morning after.
**Fred**<br>
 Definitely in bring-it-home mode, yeah.<br>
 It has that melancholy tone I agree.<br>
 Reflective.
**[“Perfect Places”]**
**André**<br>
 Compare this to that Lady Gaga album last year.<br>
 A 20-year old is taking pop to a new level.
**Fred**<br>
 Yeah, this is fantastic.<br>
 What a lovely closer too.
**André**<br>
 Absolutely.<br>
 I’ll definitely be returning to this.
**Fred**<br>
 Same. Plenty.<br>
 Surely that’s one of the best releases of the year?
**André**<br>
 I think only time will tell.<br>
 That was a really nice listen.<br>
 I’ll be coming back to it.<br>
 I’ve not listened to much pop this year, but I’m willing to bet it’s a lot better than the new Katy Perry album for instance.<br>
 Not too a dissimilar vibe to The XX in places, and I really enjoyed their album this year too.<br>
 But yeah, overall, I’m impressed.<br>
 She has quite the career ahead of her.
**Fred**<br>
 Lovely stuff.<br>
 She certainly does.<br>
 Goddammit.
**André**<br>
 Green Light – what a red herring haha.<br>
 A lot of the best albums in recent memory have those fantastic opening tracks that set an initial tone, but the rest of the album follows a different direction.<br>
 Burn the Witch from A Moon Shaped Pool, Soothing from Semper Femina..<br>
 I’m not sure Melodrama is as good as those records. But it’s a fine album on first listen.
**Fred**<br>
 It’s extremely solid. As you say, time will tell.<br>
 Extremely good first impression though.<br>
 Extremely.<br>
 Extremely.<br>
 And she’s only 20.
**André**<br>
 I think you nailed it with that ‘classy Disney’ shout.<br>
 The songs have the drama of your Frozen ballads, but the class and craft of something greater.
**Fred**<br>
 It’s a good vibe.<br>
 Dramatic even.<br>
 Ah, she’s failed spectacularly!
