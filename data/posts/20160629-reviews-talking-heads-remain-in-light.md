review: <div class="_d97"><p><em>Remain in Light</em> is a sheer delight to
  listen to. It thrives on its character, never ceasing to be thoroughly
  entertaining. The opening portion of the record springs along with a playful
  energy, and the second half is a haze that floats by at its own steady pace,
  drawing comparisons to albums of a similar era such as David Bowie’s <em><a
  href="reviews/david-bowie-low/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Low</a></em>. The music supplies a wonderful backdrop, fuelled
  by percussion and driven with intricate polyrhythms, but the heart and soul
  derives from David Byrne, who recites with humour and wit, at the brink of
  cynical satire. His lyrics are sharp and insightful, at times highly comical,
  and his delivery is exceedingly expressive. Byrne’s wonderful wordplay
  combines with the minimal funk aesthetic to create one of the most joyous
  sound displays of anxiety you’re ever likely to hear on record. Naturally,
  Brian Eno’s production is fantastic, and remains a core reason as to why
  <em>Remain in Light</em> still sounds so good in 2016. Many tracks are
  incredibly dense — impenetrable yet captivating — with African percussion
  being a prominent and distinct feature. Eno’s work allows space for the first
  segment of tracks to be flavoured with brilliantly erratic guitar work by
  Adrian Belew, before shifting the focus onto more textural and atmospheric
  songs that permit Byrne to channel his inner chronicler. It’s a change of pace
  that the album greatly benefits from, though the closing track can sometimes
  feel like an awkward and inelegant way to finalise proceedings. This aside,
  <em>Remain in Light</em> is remarkably accessible for something so bold and
  experimental. It ultimately ends up being endlessly listenable more than
  anything else, and stands as one of the major highlights of the early ’80s. It
  ticks along with a confident twitch that has inspired many of today’s great
  artists — with its lasting legacy, it continues to remain in the
  light.</p></div>

review: Talking Heads cast a long shadow, and *Remain in Light *is a huge reason
  for that. Little about the album is uniform, yet it endures as one of the most
  airtight musical projects there is. This is one for the audiophiles. Under the
  Midas wing of Brian Eno, Talking Heads juggle African genres with Western
  experimentation and innovative digital play, glazing the whole affair with
  almost delirious David Byrne lyrics and delivery. The opening half of the
  work, culminating in the timelessly wonderful “Once In A Lifetime”, makes for
  a pulsating funk, whilst the latter settles into a more ruminative, enveloping
  aura. I tend to find myself drawn more to the opening tracks, but preference
  is nothing if not changeable on a work like *Remain in Light*. The whole
  record vibrates restlessly in the overlap between cerebral and spiritual, and
  what you click with at a given time will depend entirely on where you’re at.
  This is a record to be loved in the moment, provided that the moment is right,
  and deeply admired and enjoyed in the meantime. A gorgeous record, as vibrant
  and fresh today as it was in 1980(!).

review: If nothing else can be said for *Remain In Light*, it’s a lot of fun to
  listen to. Fortunately, despite this being my first exposure to a Talking
  Heads LP, I’ve found a lot more to like. With strong influences of Cuban and
  African music and high energy from the opener, the album is sun-soaked and has
  a focus on rhythms and drum patterns that make up a huge part of this energy.
  David Byrne’s vocals remain distinctive throughout as he experiments with
  spoken and sung lyrics, contrasting particularly well in “Houses in Motion” as
  Tina Weymouth’s bassline leers into each new phrase underneath. “Once in a
  Lifetime”, which to this day receives regular playtime on the radio, manages
  to sound uplifting and frivolous on the surface while delivering lyrics that
  are quite at odds with this, adding depth that may otherwise be missing from
  an album like this. The whole record was a result of a great deal of
  experimentation and the realisation of a changing landscape at the time. This
  has done wonders for *Remain In Light*, still sounding fresh and exciting
  while maintaining a familiar sound, intrinsic of its time. All this comes
  together to produce a great album that should be damn good fun to listen to
  and, technically, has some impressive highlights all round. I’ll certainly be
  diving into the rest of the discography.
