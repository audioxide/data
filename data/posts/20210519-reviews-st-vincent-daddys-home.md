  St. Vincent returns with a luxuriously laidback affair, _Daddy’s Home. _Blending the fizzy synths of Annie Clark’s more recent work with moody, funky atmospheres, rich backing vocals and threads of psychedelia, this is a tracklist that leans into the 70s aesthetic unabashedly.


  It shouldn’t be a surprising turn either, as Jack Antonoff returns with production, writing and performing credits on this album. Having also had a hand in Lana Del Ray’s _[Chemtrails over the Country Club](/reviews/lana-del-rey-chemtrails-over-the-country-club/)_, it’s not hard to draw comparisons between material on both albums. Here, “Candy Darling” in particular has a familiar sepia-toned sheen to it, with twinkling, delicate guitar tones that hug the central vocals.


  _Daddy’s Home_ does more for me though. With the 70s vibe leaking into moments of [Pink Floyd](/reviews/pink-floyd-the-dark-side-of-the-moon)-esque, dreamy psychedelia on “Live In The Dream” and Clark finding (maybe a tad too much of) her inner Prince in the album’s title track, there’s bite and character throughout the tracklist. “Down” is a particular highlight which quietly builds out from simmering start to infectious groove, featuring a snarled edge to its vocal and some delightful musical moments.


  With this new edge to her sound, it’s clear that no two St. Vincent releases are going to sound alike. Between her late 00’s output and now, there’s been quite the progression, and as the synths fall behind shimmering guitars, organs and grooves here, it looks set to continue. But with it, the sharper, noisier cuts we’ve seen in previous work have been left behind, replaced instead with brief lulls of dreamy haze midway through the record. Whether that’s a brief flirtation or a sign of a future direction is yet to be seen, but for now, _Daddy’s Home_ firmly earns its place in a growing list of excellent music this year.
