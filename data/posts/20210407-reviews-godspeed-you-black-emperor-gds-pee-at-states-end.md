  Canadian post-rock champions Godspeed You! Black Emperor return once again, with more music that sounds larger than life itself. If the grandiose nature of their previous material hasn’t clicked with some listeners in the past, _G_d’s Pee AT STATE’S END_ is unlikely to change that. The band perform captivating protest music with commanding authority: powering through huge arrangements that convey a wide array of emotions. Theirs is a blueprint that has now existed for over 25 years. What separates _State’s End_ to other records in the catalogue, however, is the overwhelming sense of hope and triumph. Godspeed You sound genuinely buoyant.


  Whenever Godspeed You release another record, it’s hard not to draw comparisons with their [magnificent 1997 debut](/reviews/godspeed-you-black-emperor-f-sharp-a-sharp-infinity), however unfair that may seem. It’s a milestone in instrumental rock music, and no album sets a scene quite like it. Though it rises to crashing crescendos, I’ve always felt that it thrives most on the subtleties. _State’s End_ is occasionally found wanting in this department. The arrangements sound bigger than ever before, but they aren’t necessarily more interesting. Strangely enough, my favourite moments on the record are mostly the most understated. “Fire at Static Valley” is an apocalyptic march that builds similarly to “The Dead Flag Blues”, playing out like pure melodrama. It’s shorter and quieter than the larger symphonic suites, but it feels far more engrossing.


  Then there’s the stunning closing track “OUR SIDE HAS TO WIN (for D.H)”, a title that, in itself, portrays the general mood of _State’s End_. Keep fighting. There is hope. We will get through this. It’s a message that I can relate to enormously right now. The music is gorgeous, offering a time to reflect, with distorted soundscapes buzzing alongside aching strings. As has often been the case with Godspeed You’s music, sometimes the quietest moments are the most powerful. Whilst _State’s End_ is no doubt a bloody good record to add to an already impressive catalogue, it does showcase that bigger is not always better.
