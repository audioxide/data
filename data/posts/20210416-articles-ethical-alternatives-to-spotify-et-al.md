News of Soundcloud switching to a more artist-centric revenue model has caused a fair amount of fanfare, but they’re not the only streaming services putting artists first. Consumer habits alone won’t save the world, but every little helps. Slowly but surely new models are establishing themselves. We’ve collected a few here.  

This is not a ranking list, merely a starting point for those wishing to learn more about alternatives to services like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube. We’re hardly the arbiters of music industry ethics, but common traits include higher payouts for streams (think one cent per listen and up), more proportional payout distribution, and co-operative organisation. Consumer habits alone aren’t enough, but we can all move the needle in our own little ways.

In no particular order, below are some of the major music streaming platforms that don’t completely shaft musicians. If there are any egregious errors or omissions let us know and we’ll be glad to update right away.

## Resonate

Founded in 2016, Resonate uses an approach called stream2own, whereby the cost of streams doubles each time until you’ve effectively bought the song and can listen to it as much as you like for no further cost. The thinking here is that users can explore and discover new music without breaking the bank. It’s only once a song hooks you that you really start to fork over the pennies, which seems fair enough.

Uniquely among those mentioned here, Resonate is a cooperative, owned by the people who use it and develop it. 

Resonate is browser-based. There is no app, though you can bookmark the web app on your phone and have much the same experience.

## SonStream

Going all in on a musician-centric model, on SonStream you pay artists directly for streams. Instead of a subscription it’s straight up pay-as-you-go — around 2.5 pence a song (or 3 cents).

If you listen to no songs in a month, you pay nothing. If you listen to 500 songs you’ll pay somewhere in the region of £12.50 (or $15). The direct line between listeners and artists is a real pro here. There’s no opaque processes whereby your money finds itself in pockets you’ve never listened to.

As far as ease of use goes SonStream is getting there. It recently rolled out apps for Android and iOS. There’s some teething to be done but for a plucky underdog without billions of venture capital to pump into development it’s not half bad. Find a song, press play, enjoy. Simples.

The catalogue is a little lean — X compared to Spotify’s Y — but it’s growing. [Radiohead](/reviews/radiohead-ok-computer/), [Talking Heads](/reviews/talking-heads-remain-in-light/), and [The Specials](/reviews/the-specials-the-specials/) are there to name but a few. The nice thing about SonStream is it costs nothing to have it installed and ready to go. If an artist is on SonStream, great, listen to them there. If not, no harm done.

## SoundCloud

The new kid on the block and possibly the biggest name to make the move.

## Bandcamp

Bandcamp isn’t exactly a music streaming service, but it’s been so terrific for artists during the pandemic that it more than merits a mention here.

A lot of artists have stores on Bandcamp, selling both music and merchandise. On digital sales Bandcamp takes a 15 percent cut, and for the merch it’s 10 percent. Although Bandcamp doesn’t pay out for streams of songs, it does make purchasing music super easy — be it for yourself or as a gift for someone else.

Keep an eye out for the next Bandcamp Friday, during which artists get 100 percent of the money spent.
