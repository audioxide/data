pullquote: A haunting goodbye
summary: Blackstar is an exquisite work made tenderly and against time. It will
  endure as a portal into the world of remembrances that grief gives birth to —
  which I suppose was its purpose. The last word. Trust Bowie to turn dying into
  performance art. Ain’t it just like him.

review: "*Blackstar* wasn’t fully realised until a few days after its release.
  The initial sensation was one of revitalization in David Bowie’s creativity,
  with the metaphors of Lazarus seemingly showcasing his tortured immortality.
  We now understand that *Blackstar* is the open book of a dying man; a work
  created and scheduled for listeners to experience at the end of Bowie’s life,
  allowing him to depart on his own terms. The result is a fitting swansong and
  a testament to Bowie’s commitment to his craft. ‘His death was no different
  from his life — a work of art’, says long-time producer Tony Visconti, who
  knows more of Bowie’s vision than most. *Blackstar* is a record that will
  haunt us for years to come, although it certainly isn’t in the same realm as
  *Ziggy Stardust*, *Hunky Dory,* and *Low*. In fact, it’s difficult to place
  *Blackstar *anywhere in the entire catalogue. It has an enigmatic character
  that separates it from any of his previous work; an aura of mystery helped
  enormously by a jazz influence that harks back to Bowie’s earliest days (the
  saxophone was, after all, one of the first instruments he began to learn as a
  child). Still, personal throwbacks such as these never sink into nostalgia.
  Bowie was always too audacious for that. *Blackstar* opts instead to embrace
  the reality of Bowie’s status and is a better record for it, with no fond
  recollection of the glory days. Some moments on the album are stronger than
  others, but the entirety of what *Blackstar* now represents is too powerful
  for one to be bothered by the minor blemishes. I cannot remember another
  musical icon leaving a final testament in such a manner. *Blackstar *is the
  final trick from a man who was always one step ahead — we were all so pleased
  to have Bowie back that we didn’t realise he was saying goodbye. Perhaps we
  had always just assumed he was immortal, which makes his death all the more
  striking. Bowie has at least left with the assurance that, just like that
  bluebird, he is now free."

review: Sentiment put aside, *Blackstar* is not quite the tour de force it
  sorely deserved to be — though it is close. It is delicate and
  defiant *mementos mori*, relaying life and death intertwined with almost
  unwavering impact. The title track rumbles and broods with phenomenal energy,
  whilst “Lazarus” is appropriately haunting. Tony Visconti’s acumen as a
  producer certainly rubs off on what goes on. You can practically see sound
  flickering in darkness. That said, I do not care at all for “Sue (Or In A
  Season Of Crime)” — it pops the entire ethereal bubble and I really wish it
  wasn’t there. Far be it from me to correct David Bowie on how to have
  written his own eulogy, but I do think had the album refrained from trading in
  the mysticism of the abyss for a spell of drum and bass right in the middle it
  could have been something truly special. Still, *Blackstar *is an exquisite
  work made tenderly and against time. It will endure as a portal into the world
  of remembrances that grief gives birth to — which I suppose was its purpose.
  The last word. Trust Bowie to turn dying into performance art. Ain’t it just
  like him.

review: With *Blackstar*, David Bowie has gone out doing what he loved, and the
  added context made this review all the more interesting. The majority of the
  album has a sinister, haunting atmosphere about it, with Bowie’s lyrics
  consistently exploring ominous ground. ‘Look up here, man, I’m in danger’
  Bowie protests in “Lazarus”, ‘I’ve got nothing left to lose.’ Prior to his
  death, the uncomfortable air throughout the album seemed unexplained; since
  then, lyrics across the album have taken on a whole new context. Besides
  adding a little poignancy though, this album doesn’t ride on its time of
  release. The instrumentation throughout combines a sinister tone with liberal
  jazz influences and electronic decoration that works very well together. Mark
  Guiliana, listed as the man behind drums and percussion, needs a special
  mention too, with beats and rhythmical moments that never ceased to impress
  me. “Sue”, the fourth track also needs a mention, managing to be the sore
  thumb of the album while finding itself high up my favourites list; Bowie’s
  drum and bass explorations are enjoyable but not preferable on *Blackstar*. As
  “I Can’t Give Everything Away” depletes itself, audibly setting the sun on an
  incredible musical career, I can’t help but feel that David Bowie’s final lap
  of glory was maybe a little understated given his back catalogue. *Blackstar*
  is nevertheless a brilliant album that now acts a mysterious, haunting
  goodbye.
