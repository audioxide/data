  Jason Pierce sculptured a magnificent journey for listeners to experience. Tortured themes, fragile vocals, irresistibly groovy basslines, beautifully spacious production, and such a curious closer. *Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space* has numerous key components. A special album, and one I love dearly.

  It really is quite beautiful, a proper labour of love. The breadth and layering of sound is stunning. You find new things to admire each time you listen. That said, the middle portion lost me a little, though I’d imagine that’s partially because the opening and closings are so good. “Cop Shoot Cop” is an odd choice of closing track, but it’s as cool as they come.

  I think we’ve actually spoken about this one less because we’ve all just been in agreement. It’s a great album, it held my attention almost the whole way through with the continually changing and layering sounds. It was great, I’ll definitely be revisiting it.
