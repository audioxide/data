summary: Revolver manages to pull off both ends of the spectrum adeptly,
  succinctly and, bar "Yellow Submarine", without controversy with regard to its
  merit. With its varied instrumentation and genre bending tracks, Revolver is
  simply a brilliant album.

review: "*Revolver* marks the beginning of my favourite period for the band, and
  despite the curious inclusion of “Yellow Submarine” I find it to be the most
  cohesive album The Beatles ever released. It’s full to the brim with ideas
  that are executed with such precision, skillfully mixed with care and
  delicacy, resulting in a complete work that somehow seems so effortless in its
  construction. *Revolver* is one of the most enjoyable pop albums of all time,
  an iconic work that will forever be used as an example for sheer songwriting
  expertise."

review: There’s not a great deal that can be said about Revolver that hasn’t
  already been quite thoroughly covered in the last fifty years. The songs are
  consistently excellent, with a rich, fresh sound and truly beautiful lyrics. I
  don’t think it’s my favourite Beatles album, but it may well catch them at
  their most cohesive. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison (and Starr, I guess) are
  tuned in to the same frequency, and the results are iconic.

review: "*Revolver* is an album that marks a change in The Beatles’ sound as
  they entered their ‘psychedelic’ period, but that doesn’t mean that there
  aren’t some great pop songs on the album. In contrast, “Tomorrow Never Knows”
  is a clear sign of this change in sound but sounds similarly fantastic. What
  makes *Revolver* such a standout album is that it manages to pull off both
  ends of the spectrum adeptly, succinctly and, bar “Yellow Submarine”, without
  controversy with regard to its merit. With its varied instrumentation and
  genre bending tracks, *Revolver* is simply a brilliant album."
