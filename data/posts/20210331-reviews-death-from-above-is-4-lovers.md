review: >-
  With each listen of _Is 4 Lovers_, I’m puzzled as to why we’ve been so hard on it. “Modern Guy” is a stonking opener, a powerful riff matched with a scrappy, distorted, electronic aesthetic. The fierce cowbell is the icing on the cake. “One + One” is similarly satisfying, with its agitated hi-hat, a driving beat and a half-time bridge reminiscent of The Strokes. “Free Animal” follows it, the bassline is sharp-edged, the wall of sound that hits the listener is satisfying, the noise is still pretty alluring.


  A third of the way through, however, things start to unravel and plateau simultaneously. The over-compressed, heavily distorted sound begins to feel limiting, almost as if it’s masking something or a lack thereof. “Totally Wiped Out” features a squealing guitar shoved to the hard right, which feels out of place.


  By the home stretch, I’m no longer puzzled and instead a touch distracted. “Love Letter” is a nice change of pace, trading distortion for clean piano, which makes for an overdue respite, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that it’s only notable for its lack of distortion next to the rest of the tracklist. Meanwhile, “Mean Streets” and “No War” have moments of haywire noise and walls of sound, but neither feels like it reaches the envisioned potential, and I’d blame the production for that too.


  Whether it’s a top-heavy tracklist or just a little homogeneous, _Is 4 Lovers_ cools down very quickly. I still thoroughly enjoy those first ten minutes, and the rest of the album isn’t a divebomb, but DFA 1979 have missed the mark here.
