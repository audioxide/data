In 2015, Andre, Andrew, and I started reviewing albums together. We’d choose a record, spend the week listening to it, spend an evening talking about it, then assign scores. We liked it, so we kept doing it, and in October of last year we hit our 250th review.

To celebrate the milestone I’m diving ([back](/articles/statsioxide-our-first-150-reviews-in-numbers)) into the numbers behind our arbitrary numbers. Who doesn’t love seeing passion projects reduced to cold, impersonal data? We’ve got average scores, genre preferences, even a bit of institutional bias. A birds-eye view, in a nutshell, if you’ll forgive the mixed metaphors. 

## Brass tacks

Our first ever album review was in January, 2015, and it was of [_Bossanova_](/reviews/pixies-bossanova/) by Pixies. It was ok. At the time Andrew and I were in the final years of our respective undergraduate degrees. Andre, having graduated a year earlier, had just started tending bar at an independent venue called the [Ramsgate Music Hall](https://www.ramsgatemusichall.com/).

Our 250th album review was in October, 2020, and it was of [_Pet Sounds_](/reviews/the-beach-boys-pet-sounds) by The Beach Boys. It was great. By then I was a journalist and international sex symbol, Andrew was a full stack developer, and Andre had worked his way up to be co-owner of the Ramsgate Music Hall. Good going.

Of our first 250 reviews 136 were of new releases and 114 were retrospectives. **It would take almost eight and a half days to play all of the albums we’ve reviewed back to back**. Their combined length is a cool 202 hours, 27 minutes, and 32 seconds (give or take a few seconds.)

Below is the full distribution of overall _Audioxide_ scores, old and new.

![Filler](article-images/statsioxide-250-all-scores.jpg)

The average _Audioxide_ score for new releases is **19.897 out of 30**. For retrospectives it’s **23.211**, and the overall average is **21.408**. The distribution of scores for new releases by year is below.

</script>
</div>

We tend to lean towards stuff we don’t think we’ll hate, which is why the top of the bell curve is higher than the likes of _Pitchfork_ or _The Needle Drop_. Still, we’re no pushovers when it comes to new releases, as shown by our top scores from each year.

| **Year** | **Highest scoring new album(s)**                                                                                         | **Score** |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **2015** | [_To Pimp a Butterfly_](/reviews/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly/) by Kendrick Lamar                                                                                  | 27        |
| **2016** | [_Blackstar_](/reviews/david-bowie-blackstar/) by David Bowie, [_A Moon Shaped Pool_](/reviews/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool/) by Radiohead                                                            | 24        |
| **2017** | [_Visions of a Life_](/reviews/wolf-alice-visions-of-a-life/) by Wolf Alice                                                                                        | 27        |
| **2018** | [_Honey_](/reviews/robyn-honey/) by Robyn, [_Bottle It In_](/reviews/kurt-vile-bottle-it-in/) by Kurt Vile, [_Joy as an Act of Resistance_](/reviews/idles-joy-as-an-act-of-resistance/) by IDLES, [_Age Of_](/reviews/oneohtrix-point-never-age-of/) by Oneohtrix Point Never | 23        |
| **2019** | [_IGOR_](/reviews/tyler-the-creator-igor/) by Tyler, the Creator                                                                                             | 23        |
| **2020** | [_Song for Our Daughter_](/reviews/laura-marling-song-for-our-daughter/) by Laura Marling                                                                                 | 25        |

_Song for Our Daughter_ by Laura Marling was the only time our highest rated album didn’t also top our year-end favourites. (It was edged out by [_RTJ4_](/reviews/run-the-jewels-rtj4/) by Run the Jewels.) In the tied years the year-end victors were _A Moon Shaped Pool_ and _Joy as an Act of Resistance_.

## Authors

Overall _Audioxide_ scores are the three author scores combined — with the three authors usually being me (227 reviews), Andre (236), and Andrew (221). The last time I did this, at the 150 album mark, the emerging trend was that Andre was the kindest reviewer, I was the harshest, and Andrew floated breezily somewhere in between. This has held true.

|            | **New releases average** | **Retrospectives average** | **Overall average** |
|------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Andre**  | 6.806                    | 7.794                      | 7.254               |
| **Andrew** | 6.741                    | 7.695                      | 7.195               |
| **Fred**   | 6.475                    | 7.600                      | 6.996               |

I know what you’re thinking and the answer is yes, I did opt for three decimal places so my average score would stay below seven.

The site has also had a rather lovely supporting cast of would-be critics who have stepped in when one of us has gone awol.

|             | **Reviews** | **Average score** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Marcus**  | 36          | 7.028             |
| **Gabriel** | 13          | 7.000             |
| **Michael** | 9           | 7.222             |
| **Tom**     | 3           | 8.000             |
| **Charlie** | 1           | 5.000             |
| **Nick**    | 1           | 10.000            |
| **Rob**     | 1           | 9.000             |
| **Kieran**  | 1           | 5.000             |

## The 27+ Club

A consequence of our three-piece review system is high scores are actually _really_ hard to get. Getting a nine from one of us is hard; averaging nines from all of us borders on miraculous. Hence the very tastefully named **27+ Club** — the albums that have scored 27 or higher.

Only 14 of the first 250 albums made it in. That’s a 5.6% success rate. Only two of those were new releases, making the success rate there a mere 1.47%. The full list of club members is below.

### New releases

- _[To Pimp a Butterfly](/reviews/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly/)_ by Kendrick Lamar
- _[Visions of a Life](/reviews/wolf-alice-visions-of-a-life/)_ by Wolf Alice

### Retrospectives

- _[OK Computer](/reviews/radiohead-ok-computer)_ by Radiohead
- _[Homogenic](/reviews/bjork-homogenic/)_ by Björk
- _[The Downward Spiral](/reviews/nine-inch-nails-the-downward-spiral/)_ by Nine Inch Nails
- _[Midnight Marauders](/reviews/a-tribe-called-quest-midnight-marauders/)_ by A Tribe Called Quest
- _[Songs in the Key of Life](/reviews/stevie-wonder-songs-in-the-key-of-life/)_ by Stevie Wonder
- _[Cosmogramma](/reviews/flying-lotus-cosmogramma)_ by Flying Lotus
- _[Meet The Be Sharps](/reviews/the-be-sharps-meet-the-be-sharps/)_ by The Be Sharps

- _[After the Gold Rush](/reviews/neil-young-after-the-gold-rush/)_ by Neil Young
- _[Kind of Blue](/reviews/miles-davis-kind-of-blue/)_ by Miles Davis

Funnily enough the first ever new release we reviewed together was _To Pimp a Butterfly_ by Kendrick Lamar. Talk about peaking early. We’ve been chasing the dragon ever since.

To date the only artist to appear more than once in the 27+ Club is Neil Young. We’ve reviewed two of his albums and both have made the cut. We love him.

## Decades

In retrospective reviews the most popular decade by far has been the 1990s. We’ve listened to 34 albums from the decade, giving an average score of 23.474. We’re all ‘90s brats, so this fits.

<div class="gif-container">
    <iframe title="Number of albums reviewed from each decade" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-lmPk4" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lmPk4/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="361"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>
</div>

The 1980s are currently the ‘weakest’ decade, scoring an average of 22.235. The highest scoring albums from each decade so far are:

|                  | **Highest scoring album(s)**                                                                                                                                       | **Score** |

| **1970s**            | [_Songs in the Key of Life_](/reviews/stevie-wonder-songs-in-the-key-of-life/) by Stevie Wonder                                                                                                                      | 28    |

| **1990s**            | [_OK Computer_](/reviews/radiohead-ok-computer/) by Radiohead                                                                                                                                       | 29    |

Not a bad bunch. The sixties, eighties, and noughties are yet to crack the **27+ Club**. The noughties is especially surprising given we were teens for a lot of that time. You’d think something would have cruised in on a wave of pure nostalgia (_Origin of Symmetry_ almost managed it) but alas no.

## Genres

Rock was by far and away our most listened to genre, with 133 of the 250 albums falling under that umbrella. The next largest was electronic with 44 albums, then hip hop with 30. You’re always playing with broad strokes when the genres are this loose, but so it goes.

<div class="gif-container">
    <iframe title="Number of reviews by genre" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-7s52w" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7s52w/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="409"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>
</div>

Rock also had the highest average score with **21.647**. Next was hip hop with **21.633**, then electronic with **21.068**. Surprising no-one, pop was the poorest performer at **20.056**. It’s not really our bag, baby.

## Genders

This was something we hadn’t looked at before — the genders of artists whose albums we’ve reviewed. We thought the results would more or less balance out and boy were we wrong. (Pun not intended, but probably appropriate.)

<div class="gif-container">
    <iframe title="Genders of those reviewed" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-a6j3g" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a6j3g/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="409"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>
</div>

We’ve reviewed twice as many solo male artists as solo female artists. More than half of the artists we’ve reviewed were groups, but even they tend to be pretty blokey affairs. Is this an industry thing? An us thing? We expect a bit of both, though let’s be real; there’s more than enough music out there for those numbers to be more representative than they are. Something for us to keep an eye on over the next 250.

## Nationalities

A similar narrowness emerges when we look at where the artists we’ve reviewed are from. The United States and England are by far the most common nationality (in that order). We’ve listened to music from 15 different countries in all so far. The _Audioxide_ empire as it stands looks pretty good to us.

![World map showing home countries of artists reviewed by Audioxide in their first 250 reviews](article-images/statsioxide-250-world-map.png)

I suspect the bias here is linguistic rather than regional or cultural, as lyrics play an important part in how we listen. Still, we’ve reviewed enough instrumental albums to know this is an area we can also stand to be more adventurous in. One of the reasons we started reviewing albums together was to introduce each other to new music, after all.

## Other tidbits 

There are a few more stats worth mentioning. Iterations of the site come to mind. We’ve built two to date. The original was [launched](/articles/welcome/) in January of 2016. A new and improved version of the site went live in November of 2020. It has more than 250 reviews and more than 30 articles, as well as a handful of interviews, listening parties, and other oddities.

Bizarrely we’ve also had a fair few visitors over the years — tens of thousands, apparently. According to Google around 4,000 people a month find the site through search engine queries. [One of our reviews has even turned up as a source on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealistic_Pillow). (We had nothing to do with it, we swear.)

![Giant cassette of 'Can I Borrow a Feeling?' by Kirk Van Houten](article-images/statsioxide-250-can-i-borrow-a-feeling.jpg)

What else… an American craftsman called Gerald Lauze [made a giant cassette of Kirk Van Houten’s Can I Borrow a Feeling?](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqOHtXEBj9d/) and used the track names from [our review on it](https://audioxide.com/reviews/kirk-van-houten-can-i-borrow-a-feeling/). Pretty cool. At over 6,000 words our longest article by far is [Charlie Clissitt’s truly epic ranking of every single Bob Dylan studio album](/articles/bob-dylan-studio-albums-ranked/).

## The numbers don’t decide

_Audioxide_ started as a hobby and that’s what it remains. We do it to enrich our lives with good music and good talk. The stats are fun — and as we’ve seen, sometimes useful — but as much as anything else they’re an excuse to look back on all the ground we’ve covered together.

Who knows where we’ll each be in another five years. Reviewing 500 albums together seems unthinkable, but then so did 250 once upon a time. Let’s see where the music takes us.
