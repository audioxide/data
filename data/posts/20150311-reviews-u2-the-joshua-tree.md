pullquote: A towering work
summary: With the assistance of both Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, U2 achieved a
  vast and powerful sound that crucially stopped itself from treading into the
  territory of the overly bombastic; here we experience U2 without the
  excruciating self-indulgence that turns listeners away from the band's more
  recent works

review: With the assistance of both Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, U2 achieved a
  vast and powerful sound that crucially stopped itself from treading into the
  territory of the overly bombastic; here we experience U2 without the
  excruciating self-indulgence that turns listeners away from the band’s more
  recent works. *The Joshua Tree* may not be my favourite U2 album, but it is
  their most refined, and I certainly wouldn’t dispute the claim of it being the
  definitive U2 record to exist in a rather eventful discography.

review: "*The Joshua Tree* is a towering work. With gusto it embarks on a
  journey over the American horizon, conveying beautifully all the chaste
  heartache that seems to entail. It’s an epic poem of sorts, and I’m not sure
  anyone could have performed it as well as Bono does. It has its grandiose
  moments, but for the most part the album sounds superb. Gets better with each
  listen, too, which is always a welcome quality."

review: This was my first real listen to a U2 album and I came in with pretty
  mixed impressions; *The Joshua Tree* improved those. While some of the more
  anthemic tracks passed me by, the instrumentation and song writing that goes
  with it is really interesting and shows a nice range without being
  inconsistent. Eno makes his mark alongside the others that produced the album
  too. I can certainly see how this has influenced others and the impact it had
  to those that listened to it on its release. With all that in mind, I still
  don’t connect with this album as much as many do, but I’ll certainly be
  returning to it.
