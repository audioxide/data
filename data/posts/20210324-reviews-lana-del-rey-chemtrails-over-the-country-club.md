  I once wrote that Josh Homme of [Queens of the Stone Age](/reviews/queens-of-the-stone-age-villains/) could slur his way through a phone book and still be the coolest man in the room. Lana Del Rey has a similar gift, though with a different specialty. She could read a grocery list and still conjure smoky visions of love and cigarettes.


  Much of _Chemtrails Over the Country Club_ is vintage Del Rey (in both senses of the word), though the really curious thing about the record is that it flies highest when she sounds least like herself. The songs flicker between sepia and technicolor, with the latter giving a tantalising sense of where she might go next.


  The ‘sepia’ tunes are stripped-down and richly harmonised, feeling almost like ghosts of Del Rey’s tried and tested sound. The title track and “Let Me Love You Like a Woman” are examples of it working. “Wild at Heart” is an example of it not. There are as many misses as hits, but even they work as husky melodic loops.


  The glimpses of a livelier, looser Del Rey are what gives the record its spark, though. “Dark but Just a Game” is so immediate and warm and lovely — think [Eels](/reviews/eels-daisies-of-the-galaxy/), or [Portishead](/reviews/portishead-dummy/) — that almost feels like it belongs on a different album. And then there’s the horn-soaked rock breakdown at the end of “Dance Till We Die”, where Del Rey sounds like she’s in the midst of the ‘60s instead of just being nostalgic for them. It’s wonderful.


  Neither ‘side’ of the album feels fully formed but there’s enough quality in both to make the album a rewarding, sometimes surprising listen. Lana Del Rey can certainly weave a mood. Here’s hoping she builds on the new ground explored here.

  I think I need new ears. My current pair seem to miss most of what Lana Del Rey’s latest release has to offer. _Chemtrails Over The Country Club_ attempts to take her music in a stripped back direction. Instead, a majority of the resulting tracklist comes off as muted, smudging the more colourful character of tracks on _Norman Fucking Rockwell!_ into a wispy cloud.


  “White Dress” opens with a half-whispered, delicate piano ballad which swells and simmers to its conclusion with splashy cymbals and doleful guitar sliding around to the left. It’s effective, but less so when it describes large swathes of the tracks on the album. In trying to remove some of the glitzy pop of previous records, it feels as though some of the colour has washed away with it too. There’s no “Venice Bitch” here, there’s not even the cinematic drama that _Born To Die_ offered, and fans seemed to be clamouring for prior to _NFR!_.


  The album does have its moments. “Dark But Just A Game” has to have some of the most interesting instrumentation and production choices on the album. The contrasting dry and reverb-y vocals between verse and chorus, the minimal beat, the trembling keys in the background. It’s a track that feels like a stripped-back pop song, and it’s hard not to make the Portishead reference alongside everyone else. “Dance Till We Die” is only notable for its second half, which suddenly gets all saxy and funky, as Lana’s vocal on the bridge howls out. I’d jump at an album closer to that vibe than what _COTCC_ offers. The closing cover of “For Free” exemplifies the rest of the album, layering on a wisp of extra instrumentation without doing much with the track. Unfortunately, I think Weyes Blood shines brighter than Lana here, and I prefer Joni’s original overall.


  Lyrically, Lana Del Rey can paint a picture, but polka dots and insta thots, and rhyming ’meant’ with ’mean’ doesn’t do much for me. Some other notable lines are those referencing bands of the 00s, which didn’t work out well for [Glass Animals](/reviews/glass-animals-dreamland) last year either.


  This album hasn’t moved me much. There’s little to grip onto as the big, produced sound has been dampened, leaving a soft, similar-sounding tracklist in its place. I’d love to hear more of that “Dark But Just A Game” closeness, or “Dance Till We Die” funk, or even a return of the shine or drama of _NFR!_ and _Born To Die_. But this one just isn’t for me.
