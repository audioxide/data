review: >-
  I once wrote that Josh Homme of [Queens of the Stone Age](/reviews/queens-of-the-stone-age-villains/) could slur his way through a phone book and still be the coolest man in the room. Lana Del Rey has a similar gift, though with a different specialty. She could read a grocery list and still conjure smoky visions of love and cigarettes.


  Much of _Chemtrails Over the Country Club_ is vintage Del Rey (in both senses of the word), though the really curious thing about the record is that it flies highest when she sounds least like herself. The songs flicker between sepia and technicolor, with the latter giving a tantalising sense of where she might go next.


  The ‘sepia’ tunes are stripped-down and richly harmonised, feeling almost like ghosts of Del Rey’s tried and tested sound. The title track and “Let Me Love You Like a Woman” are examples of it working. “Wild at Heart” is an example of it not. There are as many misses as hits, but even they work as husky melodic loops.


  The glimpses of a livelier, looser Del Rey are what gives the record its spark, though. “Dark but Just a Game” is so immediate and warm and lovely — think [Eels](/reviews/eels-daisies-of-the-galaxy/), or [Portishead](/reviews/portishead-dummy/) — that almost feels like it belongs on a different album. And then there’s the horn-soaked rock breakdown at the end of “Dance Till We Die”, where Del Rey sounds like she’s in the midst of the ‘60s instead of just being nostalgic for them. It’s wonderful.


  Neither ‘side’ of the album feels fully formed but there’s enough quality in both to make the album a rewarding, sometimes surprising listen. Lana Del Rey can certainly weave a mood. Here’s hoping she builds on the new ground explored here.
