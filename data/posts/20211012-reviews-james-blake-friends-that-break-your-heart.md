review: >-
  I have made peace with the likelihood that James Blake albums will always be variations of the same thing. True to form, _Friends That Break Your Heart_ is elegant, gentle, polished, and aimless ambient fare with sprinklings of pop. It is all these things over the course of 44 minutes rather than 144 minutes, so listens are pleasant rather than drawn out.


  Highlights? There are a couple of solid Blake efforts to fight his way out of his paper bag. The vocals on “Coming Back” are sumptuous even by his very lovely standards, while “If I’m Insecure” is as close to an anthem as I’ve heard from him - with synths aplenty, of course. Otherwise I struggle to hold onto much. Those who like Blake’s sound will find plenty to like here. Those looking for him to build on the signs of evolution in _[Assume Form](/reviews/james-blake-assume-form/)_ will find little. The only wildcards are the features, and I’m not sure they land.


  At this point reviewing James Blake albums feels like my own personal version of _Groundhog Day_, except I don’t grow as a human being or shack up with a MacDowell at the end. There are only sombre sound bites, forever. No doubt we can all look forward to the next round in a year or two.
