review: '<div class="_d97"><p>Whilst it doesn’t necessarily reach the heights of
  earlier work, <em>Every Country’s Sun</em> has everything you’d want in a
  Mogwai album. The sound is vast, vivid, and mostly compelling, as the band
  strike a fine balance between progression and familiarity. When Mogwai go
  massive, they erupt like a violent volcano that threatens imminent destruction
  — a trait that was at the forefront of 2015’s <a
  href="reviews/atomic/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"><em>Atomic</em></a>, and a loose attribute that actually
  stretches back to the band’s earliest works. Significantly, they are just as
  masterful aiming for the other end of the dynamic spectrum, and it’s these
  subtler, almost graceful moments where Mogwai truly sound the part. “Don’t
  Believe the Fife” is one such highlight, standing with the band’s best work.
  At times, the formula of <em>Sun</em> borders on predictable, which is
  understandable given this is the band’s ninth LP, but thankfully there is
  enough experimentation to warrant the hour-long album length. “Party in the
  Dark” is an early welcome surprise, rocking wistfully like a New Order track,
  vocals ‘n all. Here Mogwai sound like a totally new band, <a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener">and to an extent they are</a>, but the
  foundations always resolve back to noisy post-rock. The band don’t evolve as
  much as they do mutate, but what’s most significant is that their music still
  sounds important; achieving a sense of scale that similar bands can only dream
  of reaching. Therein lies the true value of <em>Every Country’s Sun</em>:
  Mogwai still possess the power to soundtrack any potential apocalypse that
  comes our way. The music is pretty great too, as it happens.</p></div>'

review: Like a fair few people, I listened to *Every Country’s Sun* for the
  first time on its BBC Radio 6 midnight debut, and it was a pretty enchanting
  experience. My fondness for the record has dimmed slightly with repeat
  listens, but not by much. It’s muscular enough to meet the expectations of
  devotees, but it’s in the gentler moments that *Sun *really shines. (Sorry).
  Stuart Braithwaite described the project as a kind of
  [‘shield’](<https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/05/mogwai-announce-new-album-every-countrys-sun-share-coolverine-listen/>)
  against [‘a very turbulent, intense
  period’](<https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/05/mogwai-announce-new-album-every-countrys-sun-share-coolverine-listen/>)
  in the Western world. Sympathise or not with his view, a sense of fancy and
  indulgence is palpable. There is something almost childlike about much of the
  album; boys with their toys finding solace in a soundscape playpen. The old
  school groove of “Crossing the Road Material” is a standout, as are the
  mystical odes of “1000 Foot Face”. The apocalyptic edge of
  [*Atomic*](<reviews/atomic/>) thunders down from time to
  time as well, especially in “20 Size”. The album’s full of powerful, seductive
  moments, no two quite the same. This makes for pleasant listening, though it
  does sometimes feel symptomatic of a lack of cohesion. *Every Country’s Sun
  *is gorgeous for its own sake, which is plenty of gorgeous to go around, but
  it seems a shame not to harness the energy a little more pointedly. Maybe
  that’s just not Mogwai’s style, but it keeps me further away than I’d like. As
  is probably appropriate, *Every Country’s Sun* listens like an immense
  post-rock mass of warmth, light, and/or incineration. Think of it as a spa day
  for your ears with the promise of a light singe.

review: With a number of very solid soundtracks under their belts, Mogwai has
  forged quite a wide ranging sound for themselves, and the lead singles, and
  album openers, from *Every Country’s Sun* do a good job of showing that range
  off. “Coolverine”, an atmospheric, pensive simmer, sits next to “Party in the
  Dark”, a moody, well-paced alt-rock track with a satisfying, distant vocal
  line. The variety is prevalent through the entire fifty-seven-minute
  tracklist, with “aka 47” holding the listener in suspense as it builds and
  swells and twinkles, fizzing to a climax before dissipating, it makes for a
  visceral listen at times albeit a bit of a slow burn. If I could ask for more
  of anything, I’d look towards “Battered At a Scramble” and “Old Poisons” as
  examples. Both raucous guitar cacophonies that come as a welcome rocky ride
  after a midsection of calm. The contrast of noisy crunch next to placid beauty
  is what makes *Every Country’s Sun* sound more like an LP than an OST and is
  likely what makes this an easier tracklist for me to enjoy next to their
  [*Atomic*](<reviews/atomic/>) soundtrack. All said,
  Mogwai have made a successful return to the studio album format, and with a
  good pace and tracklist that, despite its length, doesn’t outstay its welcome.
  I can certainly see myself returning for more.
