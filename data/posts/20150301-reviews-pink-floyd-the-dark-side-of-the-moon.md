artworkCredit: was designed by English graphic artist Storm Thorgerson. ‘It related mostly to a light show,’ he said. ‘They hadn’t really celebrated their light show. That was one thing. The other thing was the triangle. I think the triangle, which is a symbol of thought and ambition, was very much a subject of Roger’s lyrics.’

  Undeniably special, *The Dark Side of the Moon* is an iconic record that will stand the test of time. I do feel, however, that one side is considerably stronger than the other - the first half is a good album, and the second half is a brilliant one. In that sense I’d suggest it perhaps falls a tad short of the greatness that it so often gets accoladed with.

  *The Dark Side of the Moon* is one of those high-water marks of artistic expression. It’s just sublime. I don’t have a bad thing to say about it. I think the two halves need each other, their relationship not unlike the one shared by the beam of light and the prism that adorn the iconic cover. If I wasn’t such an impassive git this album probably would have changed my life. I’ve chosen favourites, but you really should just listen to it all in one go.

  I think the fact that I feel almost drained after listening to this album proves that *Dark Side of the Moon* certainly makes me feel something more than an average album, takes me on a journey. There are some stand out tracks, but together, with the range of instruments and the interesting time signatures and melodies sprinkled through it, it really can put you in a dream like trance, which isn’t an easy thing to achieve!
