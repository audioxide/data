Alan Hazard gazed into the eyes facing him. They were his, and they were the most beautiful brown eyes in the world, muddy with interior mystery and allure. His nose, well, it was a masterpiece. The mouth was something else altogether. Where others may have seen lips that were thin and wet and tight, he knew better. He saw the laughter they promised, the smile ready to tell anyone who saw it that he had it all figured out don’t you worry. It was all the mirror could do to keep itself from shattering into a thousand pieces when Hazard unleashed what he thought was a wry, knowing smile. 

He had been admiring himself in the hotel room bathroom for 45 minutes. The rest of the band - his subordinates as he liked to think of them - were busying themselves with songwriting or some such nonsense. Hazard had taken the chance to slip away and think about something more important: himself. 

It was his destiny to be a front man. He’d always known that. The role fitted his looks, his charisma, and his reluctance to buckle down and learn to play an instrument properly. That would have needed work. No thank you.

Muffled through the door he could hear another tender, soaring Bas melody. Waltz and Stone were following it as best they could but it was clear who was conducting. The boy was a marvel, a musical and medical marvel. And he, Alan Hazard, had spotted him. That more or less made Bas’s genius his genius. 

He applied more eye liner and leaned back to admire the full effect. 

How long before Laina secured him a front page feature? Photographers would be climbing over themselves to shoot him (this in time proved to be true, though not in the way Hazard imagined). Fashion brands too would be clamouring to be seen adorning his sickly form. Take a close look, kids. Buy our gear and maybe you could grow up to be like Alan Hazard from the Band with No Name.

Hazard shook his head. Perfection. Pure, unadulterated perfection. It was a burden of sorts, carrying the flag for all that was great and good in the human race, but Hazard knew he was up to the task. It could be no-one else but him. He was the most important person in the world. 

Echoes of something Sunshine said to him bounced around the back of his ever growing head. It was a request, something about lyrics and how he needed to write them, urgently. The echoes annoyed him. They sounded suspiciously like responsibility. Another word duly pushed them aside.

The word was me. Me me me. Me. Me me me me me. What a marvel that two letters could contain such depth and beauty, its sound soft and deep and suitably like a self-satisfied hum. 

Hazard turned to the makeshift shrine he’d made for himself and lit another piece of incense. He inhaled deeply. All the poets he’d plagiarised over the years must have been writing about moments like this. He was the leader of a band. Whether the others recognised that or not was unimportant, like they were. He was already making headlines. And in a couple of hours he’d be performing to the adoring swine of whatever town it was they were in. Alan Hazard was on his way to the top, where he belonged. 

He glanced around to make sure the room really was empty (you could never be sure with Laina Gould around) then he leaned forward and kissed the mirror. Tongue and all.
