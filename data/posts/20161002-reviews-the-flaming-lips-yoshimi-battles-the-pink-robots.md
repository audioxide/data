review: '<div class="_d97"><p>The tenth studio album from The Flaming Lips is an
  ambiguous musical fantasy, telling the tale of a fictional character named
  Yoshimi who defeats evil robots using the power of love, wonder, and…
  existentialism. Wayne Coyne assembles this musical in typical Lips fashion,
  using a colourful blend of sprightly synths, stirring basslines, and whimsical
  lyrics. It’s nonsense. Beautiful, vague nonsense. In trying to tie down a
  detailed narrative, <em>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</em> ends up being
  remarkably unfocused; built upon scattered moments that listeners are required
  to join together. It doesn’t exactly answer its own questions, and its depth
  can certainly be put into question, but so long as you take the album at face
  value, there’s a bundle of enjoyment to be had. The overall sound is
  consistent enough for the album to get away with the occasional oddity
  (“Yoshimi Pt. 2” sounds like The Flaming Lips covering a&nbsp;<a

  rel="noopener">Sonic The Hedgehog boss battle</a>), but it remains too obscure
  to make any sort of sense.</p><p>In my mind, <em>Yoshimi Battles the Pink
  Robots</em> functions best as a fantastical journey of curious thoughts and
  emotions. It’s clumsy, yet very loveable, and there’s nothing else quite like
  it. There are a handful of highlights that have become classics over time: the
  sweet and stomping sound of “Yoshimi Pt. 1”; the contagious chorus of “Do You
  Realize??”; the mysterious melodies that comprise “Are You a Hypnotist??”.
  These are some of the finest songs in the entire Lips discography, and are
  beloved sing-alongs at concerts. The record has its fair share of flaws, but
  the high points wrap you in enough warmth to ensure a mostly wonderful
  experience. Its underlying message is to live for today, and to forget about
  the potential fear of the future, but <em>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</em>
  will ultimately mean different things to different people. Its reflective
  quality means you get out of it what you put in, and one way or another, it
  takes a special kind of album to do that.</p></div>'

review: Boasting a lovely lightness and colour of sound, the Flaming Lips’s
  tenth studio album seems to me like a childish fantasy. *Yoshimi Battles the
  Pink Robots *is baffling and nonsensical, but in a unique, creative, and
  colourful way. Although it very, very, very vaguely threatens to be a concept
  album, in practice it jumbles into something far more abstract and clumsy.
  Influences ranging from psychedelia to manga are pieced together throughout,
  although often toward a directionless end. As agreeable an impression as the
  album tends to make, it is a little mushy. It’s often charming in its
  childishness, but I’m not charmed by it. I find myself indulging it rather
  than believing it. The shiny whimsy of what goes on does not enchant me; it
  leaves me glazed. The record feels overproduced, in every sense of the word,
  which keeps it from being more than pretty surface matter. Why is the album
  laughing and applauding at itself all the time? What on earth are the
  screaming noises on “Yoshimi Battles Pt. 2” for? Horrible. That said, these
  frustrations reflect a singular sense of let-down I get from the album. If it
  wasn’t so painstakingly produced, I think I’d fall for the scattered childhood
  memory cloud hook, line, and sinker. As things are, it’s a deeply pleasant
  listen with all the actual depth of a clean, sparkly pool of pink water.

review: I’ve got a lot of love for The Flaming Lips’ tenth studio album. Setting
  its sound firmly between that of a live band and electronic outfit, *Yoshimi
  Battles The Pink Robots* has a distinctive, sometimes cinematic, always sunny
  style that stays with me long after each listen. Couple it together with a
  (very) loose narrative about the titular Yoshimi and her battle and it should
  sound intriguing to most just on paper. In practice, *YBPR* does a lot in 45
  minutes. Instrumentally, there are some impressive performances from the three
  band members across a variety of talents, with all three providing vocal and
  songwriting work for the album. The guitar, bass and drum arrangements of
  their previous work can be heard next to washes of otherworldly and squelchy
  synths and effects, giving the album its neo-psychedelic tinge and drawing a
  lot of comparisons with artists like Air and [Daft
  Punk](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/daft-punk-discovery/>) around the same
  period. Slow moving strings and additional percussion including tubular bells
  and timpani drums add a cinematic, interesting, warm sound to many tracks too.
  The instrumentals are where this melting pot of sound is allowed to shine,
  with “Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Pt. 2” pausing for a three minute, noisy
  jam, and “Approaching Pavonis mons by Balloon” closing the album (rather
  abruptly!) with a serene, warming, gently evolving track. Lyrically, there’s
  nothing groundbreaking or soul destroying here, but tracks like “Do You
  Realize??” will likely get many into a reflective mood, with its pretty yet
  morbid themes. With all that said, my score feels a little low. It’s a *very*
  strong 8 for me, but listening more critically, the slightly over-glossed
  production makes portions of *YBPR* a little easy to forget, especially where
  there’s less depth in some tracks nearer the end of the tracklist; and if I’m
  being nit-picky, the album’s close really does feel a little rushed and
  unconsidered when compared to the seamless flow of the opening third. A solid
  album for me that I’ll continue to return to for years to come, I’d expect.
