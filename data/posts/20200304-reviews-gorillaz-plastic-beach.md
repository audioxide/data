review: "<div class=\"_aok _7i2m\" aria-label=\"With Plastic Beach celebrating
  its 10 year anniversary this month - a rather frightening fact in itself -
  I've been thinking about the journey that the Gorillaz project has gone
  through since its inception. 2005's Demon Days is widely considered to be the
  essential work, capturing that satisfying sensation of sombre pop with an
  array of fantastic sonic fusions. Although I find the albums closing moments
  to be slightly underwhelming, at least in comparison to the rest, it does
  retain a delicious darkness throughout its playtime. Plastic Beach, on the
  other hand, is far more thematic, arguably more cohesive, and certainly more
  interesting in its production. Songs are covered in a plastic sheen that lends
  itself to the overriding concept, and it sounds gorgeous. However, it does
  also contain a higher amount of guest features, and this is where many fans
  take issue with recent Gorillaz output. On Humanz, Damon Albarn's vocals were
  a welcome relief from the overpowering amount of collaborations. It just
  doesn't '*feel* like a Gorillaz album. Conversely, I think Plastic Beach gets
  the balance absolutely spot on. Despite over a dozen featured guests, Albarn
  remains the prominent figure, almost a father-like figure. The Gorillaz family
  decide to take a warm and relaxing vacation, with fond friends welcoming them
  on arrival. Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach. After a slightly
  sketchy start, it doesn't take long for Plastic Beach to hit its stride.
  “Rhinestone Eyes” is vintage Gorillaz: classic 2-D crooning combined with
  playful synths. Better still is the synth-pop highlight “On Melancholy Hill”,
  which may well be one of Albarn's finest moments in his constantly-evolving
  career. Bobby Womack, De La Soul and even Lou Reed contribute in their own
  unique ways, but the stand out collaborator is undoubtedly Little Dragon's
  Yukimi Nagano. Her vibrant and dynamic voice lends itself perfectly to the
  Gorillaz aesthetic, making both “Empire Ants” and “To Binge” two of the finest
  tracks on the record. While the hip-hop features on Demon Days often made for
  the best moments, I think Plastic Beach finds success in the more melodic
  regions. However, even with all of its experiments, the success rate is still
  high, which in itself is some accomplishment. In addition to the moody
  pop/electronica blend that Gorillaz is so well-known for, Albarn incorporates
  elements of jazz, dancehall, and oriental music. It somehow sticks together
  magnificently well. I suppose this has always been the main lure of Gorillaz,
  and is perhaps the reason why such a broad band of people have listened to the
  music since the days of “Clint Eastwood”. The experiment may have gotten out
  of hand in recent years, but the equilibrium that Plastic Beach achieves
  continues to delight. I think it's Albarn's most imaginative work to
  date.\"><p>With <em>Plastic Beach</em> celebrating its 10-year anniversary

  What a pleasure it is listening to Gorillaz in full flow. I don’t think
  *Plastic Beach* is the group’s best outing (that would be [*Demon
  Days*](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/gorillaz-demon-days/>)) but it’s
  probably the most fun. Despite the all-star lineup of collaborators the ‘band’
  still just about holds together, and everything’s packaged in an immutable
  groovy sound. It’s vibing, jiving beach party.

  When the album’s in full swing it’s as good as any pop out there. “Empire Ants” is an all time great Gorillaz track, with Little Dragon’s Yukimi Nagano soaring high. It’s make-you-weak-at-the-knees gorgeous. “Stylo” is another top drawer collaboration, its lush groove irresistible. The band show they can still do it on their own with tracks like “Melancholy Hill”, which is vintage 2-D murmuring. I also have a huge soft spot for “Glitter Freeze”, a kind of Rocky Horror Light Show. Mark E Smith of [The Fall](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/the-fall-this-nations-saving-grace/>) is the perfect man to have at its centre. *Plastic Beach*’s finest moments sound, appropriately, like synthetic luxury. It’s buoyant and aspirational, feeling like a release of tension after the comparative harshness of *Demon Days*.

  That said, I do also think this marked the point where [the ‘band’ started to splinter and fade](<https://audioxide.com/articles/gorillaz-go-1-d/>). A few tracks feel like a bridge too far, if not straight up duds. “White Flag” and “Sweepstakes” don’t land, and for all its charm the album does feel a little bloated. It’s a less disciplined iteration of the Gorillaz project, for better and for worse. When all is said and done I’m delighted it’s part of the discography.

  *Plastic Beach* was always going to struggle to compete against the runaway
  success of its predecessors. [*Demon
  Days*](<https://audioxide.com/reviews/gorillaz-demon-days/>) made a hit out of
  every single that came from it. But ten years on, it feels as though this
  maybe should’ve had more of a look in.

  From its orchestral opening to its simmering Snoop Dogg collaboration it’s clear *Plastic Beach* is not going to be hemmed in. Damon Albarn’s recent orchestral score, *Journey to the West*, combined with big names the band could now collaborate with led to a mixing pot of ideas and it comes across. For me it’s less a cohesive track list, and more an hour’s whirlwind of music.

  That said there are some Gorillaz hallmarks – the sizzling synths, the laidback, summery guitar hooks, and a healthy portion of input from the band members themselves. Where more recent albums have ceded the band’s original style in favour of collaboration-led tracks, *Plastic Beach* finds a balance that adds a flavour of the collaborators to firmly Gorillaz-sounding tracks.

  Highlights for me come from the title track’s dreamscape, “Empire Ants” which lazily breezes through five minutes with one of many excellent Little Dragon features, and the bloops and bleeps of “Sweepstakes” which make way for a stonking set of horns at its peak.

  It’s not my favourite album of theirs, but I’ve thoroughly enjoyed taking *Plastic Beach* for another spin, there are some gems to be found here that still sit far above the band’s more recent output.
