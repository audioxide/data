**[“You Think I Ain’t Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire”]**
<div><p><strong>André</strong><br> Still one of my favourite album opener of all time.<br> That explosion still blows my mind.</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> ‘Prepare to have your mind expanded, friend.’</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I think a big part of why people find Nick Oliveri’s screaming tolerable is because it’s quite low in the mix.<br> And nicely mixed, furthermore.<br> I hear a lot of people say ‘I don’t like scream vocals in metal… except when QOTSA did it’</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> I think it’s because they treat it as part of something bigger<br> Rather than the main event</p><p><strong>[“No-one Knows”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> That 1-2 combo is SO good<br> Not a huge surprise that this album has more songs from Songs for the Deaf than any other</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Did any albums not make the cut at all?</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Yeah. Lullabies to Paralyse<br> Which is some people’s favourite actually<br> Has some fab singles like Little Sister and Burn the Witch<br> Even a Villains song made it…</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> So what is this?<br> …Vulgar Songs for Villains (Rated R)</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Hahaha<br> Yes<br> Grohl’s drumming still reigns supreme here, my goodness.<br> I will never get bored of No-one Knows.</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Safe choice putting it second<br> Works well, would you believe</p><p><strong>André<br></strong>Incase you didn’t know – whatever place the songs are on this album, are the places the songs are from on that respective album<br> So, this next song, If Only, is the 3rd song from the debut album too<br> Pretty neat! Well done r/qotsa</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Interesting!</p><p><strong>[“If Only”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Love that riff<br> Josh sounds so young!</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> The production bridges over pretty well</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> When Josh Homme speaks about ‘robot rock’, this is one of the tracks that always comes to mind</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> It’s just so cool<br> And not ironically cool<br> Looking at you, Villains</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Driving with the roof down on a Summer’s day kinda cool</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> So did you vote in this?</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I did</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Any of your songs not make the cut?</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Plenty<br> I CANNOT believe Song for the Dead didn’t make it<br> An utter travesty<br> Instead we have this…</p><p><strong>[“If I Had a Tail”]</strong></p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Ah I adore this song<br> 1 2 3 4…</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I dig it. It’s just no Song for the Dead is all<br> Sublime groove though, no doubt</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> This is the song I was thinking about when I said Homme could make a phone book sound groovy</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Haha<br> I think in many ways Like Clockwork is Homme’s best work<br> Songs for the Deaf is my favourite but this album just really hit the spot<br> It almost felt like Queens of the Stone Age v2.0<br> Previous albums were good but not like this</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> You know when talented footballers reign in the flair to make the most of their potential?<br> That’s how I feel about the two<br> Songs for the Deaf is more exciting<br> But Clockwork is immaculate</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> If it had a stronger opening track, like SftD does, it would have been a near masterpiece<br> The only song that lets it down in my opinion</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Ah, I like it</p><p><strong>[“Better Living Through the Chemistry”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I’m SO glad this song made it<br> One of the tunes that made me fall in love with the band as a teen<br> Riffs fucking everywhere<br> Plus BONGO’S</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> What else?<br> This playlist injects a good variety doesn’t it?</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> For sure<br> There’s even a piano ballad later on – gosh<br> But this is proper stoner rock<br> Love it</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> It’s like this song was custom made for people like you to nerd out<br> And me, to be fair</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> This had stiff competition too – My God is the Sun, The Sky is Fallin’, Burn the Witch</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Yep, good company<br> Haha, even the L/R balance is all over the place<br> Love it</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Haha yeah they branched out on Rated R<br> This was definitely the most drug-fuelled one<br> I mean the album starts off with Feel Good Hit of the Summer…</p><p><strong>[“Un-Reborn Again”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Ah, the best Villains song</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> We called it</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> We’re rarely wrong, Fred<br> This works so well after Chemistry</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Such a funky song<br> This is the only one on the record where they got the production just right</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Sounds fucking great doesn’t it<br> I associate the album with a distinct lack of low-end punch, but not this one<br> And those synths sound FAB</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Serious crunch</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> It has a snarl<br> That all QOTSA music should do</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> But it also nails the kitsch tone</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> It does<br> I love Homme’s delivery too</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> It’s spot on</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I haven’t gone back to Villains much, but I’m loving this!</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> This was why Villains was frustrating though. The rest of the album could have been like this but it sounded like it had been entombed in plastic</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> You’re right…<br> Ronson takes a good share of the blame, but not all of it</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> God the outro is so great</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> The strings are a nice touch<br> As is the sax!</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> ‘Do dooooo’</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Magnificent</p><p><strong>[“Mexicola”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Yay another riff-fest!<br> Cannot get enough of this song<br> Strange hearing his voice so low in the mix though<br> You can tell his confidence wasn’t high back then, as a singer</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> He sounds good<br> Not as refined maybe, but that’s part of the charm I suppose</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Yeah I think so.<br> I think the debut album was more about the riffs, the grooves and the attitude<br> Song-writing came with Rated R.<br> Think this stands up to something more modern like Un-Reborn Again?<br> Or does it sound dated to you?<br> I think it sounds of it’s time for sure, but still sounds great</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> I think there’s some yin and yang about it<br> Un-Reborn sounds great, but it’s so polished</p><p><strong>[“3’s &amp; 7’s”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> That wasn’t a particularly smooth transition on the production front<br> I didn’t vote for this, but it’s a great single</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> I actually thought the drop from Un-Reborn to Mexicola worked a treat<br> But yeah, the climb back up to this, not so much</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I voted for In the Fade here<br> Which is a bit more laid-back, slower pace.<br> Which I think was necessary after Mexicola<br> But hey ho<br> This is still a TUNE</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> It is<br> I don’t think it works very well in the playlist</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Agreed, probably the weakest spot</p><p><strong>[“I Appear Missing”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Ahhhh</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Here we go</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> The behemoth<br> My god this song..<br> Is this the best thing Homme has written?<br> Sorry, that’s a bit disrespectful to the rest of QOTSA, I’m fairly sure they all write it</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> It’s out there now, Andre<br> I’ll edit out that other stuff because it was vulgar, but that stays</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> It’s ok reddit doesn’t have a history of witch-hunts….<br> *ahem*<br> The drums !!!<br> Jon Theodore you boss</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> This is a great song, but I’d say it hits harder in the context of the album</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> 3’s &amp; 7’s lessens its impact slightly<br> I think when it comes down to it, my favourite QOTSA song will always be between this and Song for the Dead.</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Amazing to think of the evolution between those two songs<br> The distance the group has travelled musically</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> They don’t get enough credit in that regard</p><p><strong>[“…Like Clockwork”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> This was the only sensible way to follow I Appear Missing, surely?<br> Well done r/qotsa</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> There are a couple of times where songs have to come in pairs</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Millionaire – No-one Knows</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Aye</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> And I Appear Missing – Clockwork</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Aye aye<br> Funnily enough, I think I’ve enjoyed Un-Reborn Again the most so far</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Who could’ve predicted that?</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Homme entering Pink Floyd orbit right about now</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I think this is their 2nd best closing track<br> I Think I Lost My Headache is my favourite</p><p><strong>[“God is in the Radio”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Oh that transition is glorious</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Songs for the Deaf really has something special<br> This song feels unstoppable every time I hear it</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> It’s wonderful<br> I think the under-stated drum beat plays a massive part<br> Grohl thrashes his way through the rest of the record but here he really does let the guitars, and Mark Lanegan’s voice, do the talking<br> He’s enabling them</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Honestly, I usually prefer that style of drumming</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I think there’s a balance to these things<br> Love this breakdown<br> DYNAMICS people. So important<br> I’m not sure the end of this song is going to fade into Fun Machine all that elegantly…</p><p><strong>[“The Fun Machine Took a Shit &amp; Died”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Yeah, no. Haha</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> This does not belong</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Doesn’t quite follow God is in the Radio does it?</p><p><strong>Fred&nbsp;</strong><br> Nooooooooo</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> But I have a lot of time for it</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Ok how about this<br> Remove 3s &amp; 7s and Fun Machine from the playlist and they can be B-sides for whatever the lead singles are</p><p><strong>Andre</strong><br> Haha hell yeah<br> The first third of the playlist was ace<br> Almost the first half, in fact</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Yeah, it’s almost uncannily good</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> But things are a little jarring after that<br> The last 2 songs are gonna work very well though, seeing as it’s the end of Songs for the Deaf haha<br> So this curated album starts and ends with two Songs for the Deaf tracks<br> Which speaks volumes</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Indeed</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> I’m a little exhausted at this point, with Fun Machine</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> We are over an hour in now</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> True enough</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Would be interested to hear r/qotsa put together a 40 minute album in whatever order they liked<br> Though the logistics of that would be horrible</p><p><strong>[“Song for the Deaf”]</strong></p><p><strong>André</strong><br> This is such an ominous song<br> I adore it</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> It probably gets harder to mesh the albums as they get further along because they’re working towards somewhere different</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Absolutely.<br> Though Like Clockwork into God is in the Radio was a fantastic transition<br> Some things just click</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> ‘Forrrr the deafffff’</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> ‘ha ha ha ha ha haaaaa’</p><p><strong>[“Mosquito Song”]</strong></p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Lush</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> With this, Like Clockwork, Headache, and of course Long slow Goodbye from Paralyse, QotSA sure know how to end a record<br> This is particularly special, it feels spiritual<br> This has been very nice<br> Thanks again to r/qotsa<br> I think the first half was outstanding so bravo</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Yeah, lovely<br> Exhausting too</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> Yeah, perhaps 14 songs is a bit much when it’s not paced accordingly</p><p><strong>Fred</strong><br> Now make a 40 minute one<br> I’ll wait</p><p><strong>André</strong><br> And I’ll vote</p><p></p></div>
