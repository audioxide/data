review: >-
  Earl Sweatshirt’s fourth album joins a small, plucky group of releases we’ve reviewed whose members feel like the musical equivalent of novellas. Too substantial to be an EP, yet lacks the weight and lasting impact of a top drawer LP.


  In the case of _SICK! _much of this can be attributed to the quick fire length, but the music itself has a fleeting in-the-moment quality that makes it unlike other hip hop release we’ve covered over the years._ _Earl’s delivery has the coarse, tumbling flow of a spoken word piece. The instrumentals, though restrained by today’s standards, shimmer and shine, each piece demanding (and earning) attention. This is a lean, to-the-point record, and better off for it. 


  The closest thing that comes to mind is _[FM!](/reviews/vince-staples-fm/)_, but I’d say Earl has made something with more staying power than that here. Is it likely to top any year-end lists? Probably not, but it’s an invigorating way to kick things off, and in the coming months will likely be a repeat listen for many - me included.
