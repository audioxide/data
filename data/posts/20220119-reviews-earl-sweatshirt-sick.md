  _SICK!_ is the type of album only Earl Sweatshirt could release, which is a delight in itself. Lo-fi, jazzy beats skitter alongside Earl’s nonchalant poetry for 24 minutes and before you know it, the record is finished. Aside from the interlude “Lobby”, I dare say a single second is wasted. No gimmicks. Just densely layered hip-hop that carries the usual level of anxiety you’d come to expect. Well, maybe a little less than usual.


  Earl’s flow is still the closest thing we have to MF DOOM, and it remains a sheer pleasure to listen to his miserable murmuring. That’s genuinely not sarcastic. The way Earl creates his music does make you wonder whether hip-hop has been stuck in the mud for a while, with much of it recycling the same traits and trademarks from years ago. In this sense, _SICK!_ feels like anti-rap. Entertaining and vitalising.


  Though I enjoy and appreciate _SICK!_, I don’t love it. At least not yet. With the record basically shunning any idea of a hook or chorus, there’s not a whole lot to hold on to. This is much of what makes Earl the fascinating and alluring artist he is. These songs are sharp and direct; like pure, unfiltered journal entries. Ultimately, Earl is still trying to make sense of the world, which is something I’m sure many of us can connect with.

  Earl Sweatshirt’s fourth album joins a small, plucky group of releases we’ve reviewed whose members feel like the musical equivalent of novellas. Too substantial to be an EP, yet lacks the weight and lasting impact of a top drawer LP.


  In the case of _SICK! _much of this can be attributed to the quick fire length, but the music itself has a fleeting in-the-moment quality that makes it unlike other hip hop release we’ve covered over the years._ _Earl’s delivery has the coarse, tumbling flow of a spoken word piece. The instrumentals, though restrained by today’s standards, shimmer and shine, each piece demanding (and earning) attention. This is a lean, to-the-point record, and better off for it. 


  The closest thing that comes to mind is _[FM!](/reviews/vince-staples-fm/)_, but I’d say Earl has made something with more staying power than that here. Is it likely to top any year-end lists? Probably not, but it’s an invigorating way to kick things off, and in the coming months will likely be a repeat listen for many - me included.
