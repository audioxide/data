review: <div class="_d97"><p>Justice’s debut album, released almost 10 years ago
  now, exploded on to the scene with bold intentions. It was loud, it was
  daring, and it was exciting, like a nu-age opera. Although its impact was
  compelling at the time <a
  href="http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/justice-respond-to-unplugged-controversy-by-posting-more-pictures-183657"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">(at least for the majority)</a>, that ‘Justice
  sound’ has had little momentum since. This wasn’t helped by a tame second
  studio album, which only polarised listeners, and, more significantly, the
  detracting force of EDM and house music that has continued to occupy the
  mainstream dance space. On <em>Woman</em>, their third full-length record,
  Justice successfully recapture their dominant sound with a collection of
  pounding disco tunes. It’s an endearing throwback to the ‘70s, made with love
  and appreciation for the scene. Rather than merely borrowing attributes,
  <em>Woman</em> celebrates its influences, and is all the better for it. The
  record feels alive; it lives and breathes like a fully formed reincarnation of
  disco. The melodies are infectious, the bass lines are rich and vibrant, and
  the drums are wonderfully expressive.</p><p>Sometimes, it just feels too
  familiar. Opening track “Safe and Sound” essentially operates in the same way
  “One More Time” did on <em><a
  href="https://audioxide.com/reviews/daft-punk-discovery/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Discovery</a></em>, and this is certainly not the only
  comparison that could be made to the ‘other’ French dance duo. Feeling
  nostalgic for the ‘70s is one thing, but <em>Discovery</em> is only 15 years
  old. Still, the core sound of <em>Woman</em> is an enjoyable one, original or
  not, and the best tracks are those that craftily blend disco traits with that
  unmistakable Justice sound. “Fire” and “Alakazam !” make for a wonderful
  one-two combination during the first half of the album, whilst “Randy” stands
  as the latter half highlight. Unfortunately, it’s followed by the only real
  misstep on the album – “Heavy Metal” plays out like a pantomime version of
  <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgkxSkF7QOU" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Castlevania</a></em>, and sticks out like a sore thumb. It’s
  the single blunder on an otherwise highly focused and consistent record.
  <em>Woman</em> may lack the dark, twisted energy of <em>Cross</em> for it to
  be ever considered a classic, but it remains a solid dance record, thriving
  instead on a positive, hopeful spirit. I reckon we were due a dose of joyful
  enthusiasm this year.</p></div>

review: Although Justice’s latest release never quite builds up a head of steam,
  I’ve no qualms saying it’s a deeply funky listen. The brutal, operatic edges
  of *Cross *are exchanged for a looser old-school sound, mixing elements of
  dance, funk, disco, and electronica into a cool, colourful character. It’s a
  gorgeous, full vibe which sounds bigger than whatever sound system it’s being
  played on. “Fire” and “Alakazam !” mark the best of what *Woman *has to offer,
  balancing its liquid sound with a genuinely commanding drive and restlessness
  — fever, you might even call it. All the choral sections are lovely. “Stop”
  especially. Lovely. It isn’t all sunshine, though. The album does that thing
  where the sound is good, but not enough is done with it. Most of the tracks,
  as agreeable as they are, don’t make themselves feel terribly essential. They
  are consistently long, which gets more noticeable the further along the album
  gets. “Chorus” is a pretty empty seven minutes. “Randy” takes *ages *to hit
  stride. The record leaks too much energy for me to get fully on board with it.
  Had Justice been a little meaner with their darlings, I think *Woman* would
  have been a strong foil to *Cross*’s more brutalist qualities. As it is, the
  album can feel needlessly slack.

review: >-
  It’s been great to see a return from Justice on their latest release, *Woman*.
  As a big fan of the cinematic, grungey crunch of their debut album *Cross*,
  and the lighter, more playful disco jaunt* Audio, Video, Disco.*, that
  followed it, my expectations were high. I can’t say I’m immensely disappointed
  either.* Woman* plays more on the disco, funk elements of the latter, which is
  clear from the outset as “Safe and Sound” thumps a weighty kick drum and a
  sharp edged bassline into the centre of the track. The better tracks are those
  that really play on the style, with “Alakazam !” making for a stand-out in the
  first half. The production and mixing of the tracks, unlike some of the
  releases we’ve seen this year, really adds to the experience, with rich rhythm
  sections giving tracks depth, while icy vocals and satisfyingly cold, brittle
  synths retain a gothic essence in among the disco sound.

  However, while the first half of the album is an enjoyable listen, the individual tracks do blend into one another all too easily, especially those that are vocal heavy. As a result, I spend most of my time with the album thinking ‘that sounds like…’ before making comparisons to output from at least 10 years ago: Daft Punk, label mate Sebastian, and Simian Mobile Disco to name just a few. Unlike *Cross*, *Woman* doesn’t have a strong sound that assures a listener that this can only be work from Justice, and tracks feel far less distinct from one another.

  This air of familiarity begins to lift towards the end of the tracklist, though “Heavy Metal” has proven particularly divisive and certainly isn’t a favourite of mine, despite my approval of the duo trying *something* different. The closer “Close Call” leaves me with a bittersweet taste, wanting more of the smokey, otherworldly atmosphere that it creates, as the heavy, harpsichord-esque synths layered on top vaguely remind me of their four part epic [Planisphere](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZgfrDMQFas>) from 2008. Alongside listening to *Woman*, this week has largely become a revisit of older material, and unfortunately, the two don’t stack up so evenly. *Woman* is a great listen in its own right, and I have a lot of good things to say about it, but it still stands in the shadow of its oldest sibling.
