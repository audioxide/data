*Audioxide* is three friends — [André Dack](https://twitter.com/andredack), [Frederick O’Brien](https://frederickobrien.com), and [Andrew Bridge](https://www.andrewhbridge.co.uk) — reviewing albums together. That’s how it started and that’s more or less what it remains, though if we’re in a self-important mood we may try to convince you it’s a music webzine.

Since starting in 2015 we’ve branched out into [articles](/articles/), [interviews](/interviews/), [listening parties](/listening-parties/), and [other oddities](/funnyfarm/). All this we do as a hobby because we enjoy listening to and discussing music. We do not use affiliate links, show ads, track visitors, or charge musicians for coverage. We encourage readers to do what they can to support the artists we write about. No, we do not get a cut. We may be a small website, but we try to be a small website that behaves properly.

A number of [lovely people](/authors) have joined us to contribute from time to time. Early branding work by [Samuel Simpson](https://www.instagram.com/autonwolf) lives on as *Audioxide* evolves. The current site was designed and built by Andrew and Fred. Its ongoing development can be followed on [GitHub](https://github.com/audioxide), and we have a [Storybook](https://audioxide.github.io/) of our components library.

To those unsure where to start we humbly direct you to our top rated albums in [the 27+ Club](/tags/27-plus-club/). For more leisurely browsing there’s [the archive](/reviews/). Or if all else fails you could always try [a random post...](/random/)

Happy listening.
