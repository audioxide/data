*Audioxide* is three friends — [André Dack](https://twitter.com/andredack), [Frederick O’Brien](https://fredobrien.co.uk/), and [Andrew Bridge](http://www.andrewhbridge.co.uk/) — reviewing an album a week. That’s how it started and that’s more or less what it remains, though if we‘re in a self-important mood we may try to convince you it’s a music webzine.

Since starting in 2015 we've branched out into [articles](/articles/), [interviews](/interviews/), [listening parties](/listeningparties/), and [other oddities](/funnyfarm/). All this we do as a hobby because we love it. We do not use affiliate links, chase ad revenue, or charge artists for coverage. We encourage readers to do what they can to support the musicians we write about. We may be a small publication, but we try to be an ethical small publication.

Other friends have joined us for reviews from time to time: Marcus Lawrence, Michael Clarke, Gabriel Sutton, [Thomas Ashby](https://thomasashby.co.uk/), [harlie Clissitt](https://twitter.com/CharlieClissitt), Nick, Rob, and Kieran. Articles have been written by Rüya Yönak and Charlie Clissitt. Sam Simpson’s original branding and design work lives on as the site evolves. The current iteration was almost entirely built by Andrew.
