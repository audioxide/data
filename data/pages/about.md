*Audioxide* is three friends reviewing an album a week. That’s how it started and that’s what it remains at its core, though we’ve added a few bells and whistles over the years.

We - Andre, Andrew, and Fred - started doing this in early 2015. We went to school together, and all being music fans we thought it'd be nice to listen to an album a week and talk about it. We’d introduce each other to new music, unpack our feelings on different artists, and generally have a good time. The early days are preserved on this GitHub page Andrew made. A year later we set up our own website - this place.

What started as a humble hobby in 2015 has evolved into a bloated, hubristic hobby in whatever year you’re reading this. We dabble in other things (articles, interviews, erotic fiction, etc.) but by and large what we do today is almost exactly the same as when we started. Our summaries are just longer.
