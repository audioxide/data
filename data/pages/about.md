*Audioxide* is three friends — [André Dack](https://twitter.com/andredack), [Frederick O’Brien](https://fredobrien.co.uk/), and [Andrew Bridge](http://www.andrewhbridge.co.uk/) — reviewing an album a week. That’s how it started and that’s more or less what it remains, though if we‘re in a self-important mood we may try to convince you it’s a music webzine.

Since starting in 2015 we've branched out into [articles](/articles/), [interviews](/interviews/), [listening parties](/listeningparties/), and [other oddities](/funnyfarm/). All this we do as a hobby because we love it. We do not use affiliate links, show ads, track users, or charge musicians for coverage. We encourage readers to do what they can to support the artists we write about. We may be a small publication, but we try to be an ethical small publication.

Others have joined us to contribute from time to time: Marcus Lawrence, Michael Clarke, Gabriel Sutton, Rüya Yönak, [Charlie Clissitt](https://twitter.com/CharlieClissitt), [Thomas Ashby](https://thomasashby.co.uk/), Nick, Rob, and Kieran. Samuel Simpson’s original branding and design work lives on as *Audioxide* evolves. The current site was almost entirely built by Andrew. Fred did a little bit.

To those unsure where to start we humbly direct you to our top rated albums — [the 27+ Club](/). For more leisurely browsing there's always [the archives](/reviews/). Or if all else fails you could always try [a random review](/)...

Happy listening.
