*Audioxide* is three friends reviewing an album a week. That’s how it started and that’s what it remains at its core. If we're in a self-important mood we may try to convince you it's a music webzine.

We - Andre, Andrew, and Fred - started reviewing in early 2015. We go way back, and all being music fans we thought it'd be nice to listen to an album a week and talk about it. We’d introduce each other to new music, unpack our feelings on different artists, and generally have a good time. That's what happened. [The early days are preserved on Andrew's Git account](https://github.com/andrewbridge/Musical-Review). A year in we set up our own website - this place.

What started as a humble hobby in 2015 has evolved into a bloated, hubristic hobby in whatever year you’re reading this. We publish other things now ([articles](/reviews/), [interviews](/interviews/), erotic fiction, etc.) but by and large what we do today is almost exactly the same as when we started. Our summaries are just longer.
