If you want to get in touch, be it to bring music to our attention or tell us our reviews suck, feel free to send an email to [fred@audioxide.com](mail:fred@audioxide.com). He’ll pass on anything pertinent. If you’d like to contact us about advertising on the site, please don’t. We’re not interested.

We very occasionally post on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Audioxide/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/audioxide), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/audioxidecom/). We’re also on [Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMNTJoAsw4dO4Aw), if you go in for that kind of thing. For something more reliable sign up to [our email newsletter](https://eepurl.com/cox6qr) to receive monthly roundups of what we’ve been up to.
