We care about your privacy. No really, we do. The site does not track visitors, record sessions, send your data to Facebook, or do any other seedy stuff like that. Don’t take our word for it either. Run us through [Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=audioxide.com) to see all the nefarious stuff we don’t do. 

For analytics we use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), a free, open source platform that provides privacy-friendly web analytics. Our data is public for anyone to view at [audioxide.goatcounter.com](https://audioxide.goatcounter.com). The only Google tool we use is [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/), for SEO best practice and the like.

For anyone interested in having a poke around under the hood, [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/audioxide) is fully public.
