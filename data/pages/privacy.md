We care about your privacy. No really, we do. The site does not track visitors, record sessions, send your data to Facebook, or do any other seedy stuff like that. Don't take our word for it either. Run us through [Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight) to see all the nefarious stuff we don't (and will never) do. 

The only analytics tool we use is [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), a free, open source platform that provides privacy-friendly web analytics. Our data is public for anyone to view at [audioxide.goatcounter.com](https://audioxide.goatcounter.com).
