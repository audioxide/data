blurb: Learn the convoluted, arbitrary system behind our convoluted, arbitrary album reviews. There is a method to the madness, we swear.
---

Our [album reviews](/reviews/) usually have four scores. Each reviewer (there are usally three) assigns a personal score out of 10 then these are combined to make the overall *Audioxide* score, which is out of 30.

This system translates into the following rating brackets:

- **27-30:** [The 27+ Club](/tags/27-plus-club/)
- **25-26:** Gold
- **23-24:** Silver
- **21-22:** Bronze

Although the scores may seem low, bear in mind how much harder it is with multiple people involved. You can only please all of the reviewers some of the time.

Each author also chooses up to three favourite tracks. Through a complex system of mathematics and human sacrifice these translate to overall favourite tracks. An ‘Essential’ track is one all three reviewers chose. A ‘Favourite’ track is one that was well liked but not selected by everyone.
