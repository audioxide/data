Our album reviews have four scores, occasionally more. We don’t do this to be difficult. Each of three reviewers assigns a personal score out of 10. These are then combined to make the overall *Audioxide* score, which is out of 30.

Naturally numerical scores are arbitrary and absurd, but that hasn’t stopped us from having the following brackets:

- 27-30 // The 27+ Club
- 25-26 // Gold
- 23-24 // Silver
- 21-22 // Bronze

These scores may seem low, but bear in mind how much harder it is with multiple people involved. You can only please all of the reviewers some of the time. 

We also choose up to three favourite tracks. Through a complex system of advanced mathematics and human sacrifice these translate to overall favourite tracks. An ‘Essential’ track is one all three reviewers chose. ‘Favourite’ tracks are those that were well liked but not necessarily by everyone.
